Transmission may also occur when these materials are directly introduced into broken skin, the nose, the eyes, or the mouth, or presumably, via the bite of an infected rodent. Person-to-person transmission has not been reported, with the exception of vertical transmission from infected mother to fetus, and rarely, through organ transplantation.","
People at risk for Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) are those who come into contact with infected rodents or their urine, droppings, or saliva. This includes individuals who work in laboratories that handle rodents, people living in urban areas with high rodent populations, and those who have rodents as pets."

For infected persons who do become ill, onset of symptoms usually occurs 8-13 days after exposure to the virus as part of a biphasic febrile illness. This initial phase, which may last as long as a week, typically begins with any or all of the following symptoms: fever, malaise, lack of appetite, muscle aches, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms appearing less frequently include sore throat, cough, joint pain, chest pain, testicular pain, and parotid (salivary gland) pain. 
                
Following a few days of recovery, a second phase of illness may occur. Symptoms may consist of meningitis (fever, headache, stiff neck, etc.), encephalitis (drowsiness, confusion, sensory disturbances, and/or motor abnormalities, such as paralysis), or meningoencephalitis (inflammation of both the brain and meninges). LCMV has also been known to cause acute hydrocephalus (increased fluid on the brain), which often requires surgical shunting to relieve increased intracranial pressure. In rare instances, infection results in myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord) and presents with symptoms such as muscle weakness, paralysis, or changes in body sensation. An association between LCMV infection and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscles) has been suggested. 
                
Previous observations show that most patients who develop aseptic meningitis or encephalitis due to LCMV survive. No chronic infection has been described in humans, and after the acute phase of illness, the virus is cleared from the body. However, as in all infections of the central nervous system, particularly encephalitis, temporary or permanent neurological damage is possible. Nerve deafness and arthritis have been reported. 
                
Women who become infected with LCMV during pregnancy may pass the infection on to the fetus. Infections occurring during the first trimester may result in fetal death and pregnancy termination, while in the second and third trimesters, birth defects can develop. Infants infected In utero can have many serious and permanent birth defects, including vision problems, mental retardation, and hydrocephaly (water on the brain). Pregnant women may recall a flu-like illness during pregnancy, or may not recall any illness. 
                
LCM is usually not fatal. In general, mortality is less than 1%.","
Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) is a viral disease. Symptoms of LCM may include fever, headache, and neck stiffness. Other symptoms can include tiredness, muscle aches, and a skin rash. However, LCM is often asymptomatic and may not cause any symptoms at all."

Owners of pet mice or hamsters may be at risk for infection if these animals originate from colonies that were contaminated with LCMV, or if their animals are infected from other wild mice. Human fetuses are at risk of acquiring infection vertically from an infected mother. 
                
Laboratory workers who work with the virus or handle infected animals are also at risk. However, this risk can be minimized by utilizing animals from sources that regularly test for the virus, wearing proper protective laboratory gear, and following appropriate safety precautions.","

Liver enzymes in the serum may also be mildly elevated. After the onset of neurological disease during the second phase, an increase in protein levels, an increase in the number of white blood cells or a decrease in the glucose levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually found. 
   
Laboratory diagnosis is usually made by detecting IgM and IgG antibodies in the CSF and serum. Virus can be detected by PCR or virus isolation in the CSF at during the acute stage of illness.","
Diagnosis of Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) typically involves a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The symptoms of LCM can be similar to other viral infections, so a definitive diagnosis may require specific tests such as serology (detection of antibodies to the LCM virus in the blood), PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to detect the virus's genetic material, or cerebrospinal fluid analysis to rule out other causes of meningitis. Imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans may also be used to visualize any potential inflammation or lesions in the brain."

Rarely, pet rodents may become infected with LCMV from wild rodents. Breeders, pet stores, and pet owners should take measures to prevent infestations of wild rodents. Pet rodents should not come into contact with wild rodents. If you have a pet rodent, wash your hands with soap and water (or waterless alcohol-based hand rubs when soap is not available and hands are not visibly soiled) after handling rodents or their cages and bedding. 
                
If you have a rodent infestation in and around your home, take the following precautions to reduce the risk of LCMV infection: 
 
 - Seal up rodent entry holes or gaps with steel wool, lath metal, or caulk. 
 - Trap rats and mice by using an appropriate snap trap. 
 - Clean up rodent food sources and nesting sites and take precautions when cleaning rodent-infected areas: 
   
   - Use cross-ventilation when entering a previously unventilated enclosed room or dwelling prior to cleanup. 
   - Put on rubber, latex, vinyl or nitrile gloves. 
   - Do not stir up dust by vacuuming, sweeping, or any other means. 
   - Thoroughly wet contaminated areas with a bleach solution or household disinfectant. 
   - Hypochlorite (bleach) solution: Mix 1 and 1/2 cups of household bleach in 1 gallon of water. 
   - Once everything is wet, take up contaminated materials with damp towel and then mop or sponge the area with bleach solution or household disinfectant. 
   - Spray dead rodents with disinfectant and then double-bag along with all cleaning materials and throw bag out in an appropriate waste disposal system. 
   - Remove the gloves and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water (or waterless alcohol-based hand rubs when soap is not available and hands are not visibly soiled). 
    
 
                
The geographic distributions of the rodent hosts are widespread both domestically and abroad. However, infrequent recognition and diagnosis, and historic underreporting of LCM, have limited scientists' ability to estimate incidence rates and prevalence of disease among humans. Understanding the epidemiology of LCM and LCMV infections will help to further delineate risk factors for infection and develop effective preventive strategies. Increasing physician awareness will improve disease recognition and reporting, which may lead to better characterization of the natural history and the underlying immunopathological mechanisms of disease, and stimulate future therapeutic research and development.","

This infection occurs after a person swallows tapeworm eggs. The larvae get into tissues such as muscle and brain, and form cysts there (these are called cysticerci). When cysts are found in the brain, the condition is called neurocysticercosis.","Parasites are organisms that live in another body, called the host, and get food and liquids from that host.

A person with an adult tapeworm, which lives in the person’s gut, sheds eggs in the stool.  The infection with the adult tapeworm is called taeniasis.  A pig then eats the eggs in the stool.  The eggs develop into larvae inside the pig and form cysts (called cysticerci) in the pig's muscles or other tissues. The infection with the cysts is called cysticercosis. Humans who eat undercooked or raw infected pork swallow the cysts in the meat. The larvae then come out of their cysts in the human gut and develop into adult tapeworms, completing the cycle.
    
People get cysticercosis when they swallow eggs that are excreted in the stool of people with the adult tapeworm. This may happen when people
    
     - Drink water or eat food contaminated with tapeworm eggs
     - Put contaminated fingers in their mouth
    
    
Cysticercosis is not spread by eating undercooked meat. However, people get infected with tapeworms (taeniasis) by eating undercooked infected pork. People who have tapeworm infections can infect themselves with the eggs and develop cysticercosis (this is called autoinfection). They can also infect other people if they have poor hygiene and contaminate food or water that other people swallow. People who live with someone who has a tapeworm infection in their intestines have a much higher risk of getting cysticercosis than other people.
    
Human cysticercosis is found worldwide, especially in areas where pig cysticercosis is common. Both taeniasis and cysticercosis are most often found in rural areas of developing countries with poor sanitation, where pigs roam freely and eat human feces. Taeniasis and cysticercosis are rare among persons who live in countries where pigs are not raised and in countries where pigs do not have contact with human feces. Although uncommon, cysticercosis can occur in people who have never traveled outside of the United States if they are exposed to tapeworm eggs.

No vaccine is available.
    
The best way to prevent schistosomiasis is to take the following steps if you are visiting or live in an area where schistosomiasis is transmitted:
    
     - Avoid swimming or wading in freshwater when you are in countries in which schistosomiasis occurs. Swimming in the ocean and in chlorinated swimming pools is safe.
     - Drink safe water. Although schistosomiasis is not transmitted by swallowing contaminated water, if your mouth or lips come in contact with water containing the parasites, you could become infected. Because water coming directly from canals, lakes, rivers, streams, or springs may be contaminated with a variety of infectious organisms, you should either bring your water to a rolling boil for 1 minute or filter water before drinking it. Bring your water to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute will kill any harmful parasites, bacteria, or viruses present. Iodine treatment alone WILL NOT GUARANTEE that water is safe and free of all parasites.
     - Water used for bathing should be brought to a rolling boil for 1 minute to kill any cercariae, and then cooled before bathing to avoid scalding. Water held in a storage tank for at least 1 - 2 days should be safe for bathing.
     - Vigorous towel drying after an accidental, very brief water exposure may help to prevent the Schistosoma parasite from penetrating the skin. However, do not rely on vigorous towel drying alone to prevent schistosomiasis.
    
    
Those who have had contact with potentially contaminated water overseas should see their health care provider after returning from travel to discuss testing.
    
More on: Schistosomiasis in Travelers
   
  
  
   Control
   
In countries where schistosomiasis causes significant disease, control efforts usually focus on:
   
    - reducing the number of infections in people and/or
    - eliminating the snails that are required to maintain the parasite’s life cycle.
   
   
For all species that cause schistosomiasis, improved sanitation could reduce or eliminate transmission of this disease. In some areas with lower transmission levels, elimination of schistosomiasis is considered a ""winnable battle"" by public health officials.
   
Control measures can include mass drug treatment of entire communities and targeted treatment of school-age children. Some of the problems with control of schistosomiasis include:
   
    - Chemicals used to eliminate snails in freshwater sources may harm other species of animals in the water and, if treatment is not sustained, the snails may return to those sites afterwards.
    - For certain species of the parasite, such as S. japonicum, animals such as cows or water buffalo can also be infected. Runoff from pastures (if the cows are infected) can contaminate freshwater sources.","
To prevent Schistosomiasis, the best method is to prevent being repeatedly bitten by the snails that carry the disease. Some methods of preventing snail bites include the following:

* Avoiding water sources where the snails live, such as rivers, lakes, and ponds, especially during the day when the snails are most active.
* Wearing protective clothing that covers the skin, such as long sleeves and long pants, when in water.
* Using a chemical barrier, such as a lotion or cream, to protect the skin from snail bites.
* Maintaining proper hand washing techniques and hygiene to reduce the risk of infection.
* In some cases, medical interventions may be necessary to control the spread of the disease in a particular area."

Head lice are not known to transmit disease; however, secondary bacterial infection of the skin resulting from scratching can occur with any lice infestation.
    
Getting head lice is not related to cleanliness of the person or his or her environment.
    
Head lice are mainly spread by direct contact with the hair of an infested person. The most common way to get head lice is by head-to-head contact with a person who already has head lice. Such contact can be common among children during play at:
    
     - school,
     - home, and
     - elsewhere (e.g., sports activities, playgrounds, camp, and slumber parties).
    
    
Uncommonly, transmission may occur by:
    
     - wearing clothing, such as hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms, or hair ribbons worn by an infested person;
     - using infested combs, brushes or towels; or
     - lying on a bed, couch, pillow, carpet, or stuffed animal that has recently been in contact with an infested person.
    
    
Reliable data on how many people get head lice each year in the United States are not available; however, an estimated 6 million to 12 million infestations occur each year in the United States among children 3 to 11 years of age. Some studies suggest that girls get head lice more often than boys, probably due to more frequent head-to-head contact.
    
In the United States, infestation with head lice is much less common among African-Americans than among persons of other races. The head louse found most frequently in the United States may have claws that are better adapted for grasping the shape and width of some types of hair but not others.","

The diagnosis of head lice infestation is best made by finding a live nymph or adult louse on the scalp or hair of a person.
    
Because adult and nymph lice are very small, move quickly, and avoid light, they may be difficult to find. Use of a fine-toothed louse comb may facilitate identification of live lice.
    
If crawling lice are not seen, finding nits attached firmly within ¼ inch of the base of hair shafts suggests, but does not confirm, the person is infested. Nits frequently are seen on hair behind the ears and near the back of the neck. Nits that are attached more than ¼ inch from the base of the hair shaft are almost always non-viable (hatched or dead). Head lice and nits can be visible with the naked eye, although use of a magnifying lens may be necessary to find crawling lice or to identify a developing nymph inside a viable nit. Nits are often confused with other particles found in hair such as dandruff, hair spray droplets, and dirt particles.
    
If no nymphs or adults are seen, and the only nits found are more than ¼ inch from the scalp, then the infestation is probably old and no longer active — and does not need to be treated.","
Diagnosis of head lice can be done by visual inspection of the scalp and hair. Common signs include itchiness and the presence of nits (lice eggs) or live lice on the hair shaft. A fine-toothed comb can be used to help detect lice and nits."

Treatment for head lice is recommended for persons diagnosed with an active infestation. All household members and other close contacts should be checked; those persons with evidence of an active infestation should be treated. Some experts believe prophylactic treatment is prudent for persons who share the same bed with actively-infested individuals. All infested persons (household members and close contacts) and their bedmates should be treated at the same time. 
   
Some pediculicides (medicines that kill lice) have an ovicidal effect (kill eggs). For pediculicides that are only weakly ovicidal or not ovicidal, routine retreatment is recommended. For those that are more strongly ovicidal, retreatment is recommended only if live (crawling) lice are still present several days after treatment (see recommendation for each medication). To be most effective, retreatment should occur after all eggs have hatched but before new eggs are produced. 
   
When treating head lice, supplemental measures can be combined with recommended medicine (pharmacologic treatment); however, such additional (non-pharmacologic) measures generally are not required to eliminate a head lice infestation. For example, hats, scarves, pillow cases, bedding, clothing, and towels worn or used by the infested person in the 2-day period just before treatment is started can be machine washed and dried using the hot water and hot air cycles because lice and eggs are killed by exposure for 5 minutes to temperatures greater than 53.5°C (128.3°F). Items that cannot be laundered may be dry-cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag for two weeks. Items such as hats, grooming aids, and towels that come in contact with the hair of an infested person should not be shared. Vacuuming furniture and floors can remove an infested person's hairs that might have viable nits attached. 
     
   
Treatment of the infested person(s): Requires using an Over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medication. Follow these treatment steps: 
    
    - Before applying treatment, it may be helpful to remove clothing that can become wet or stained during treatment. 
    - Apply lice medicine, also called pediculicide, according to the instructions contained in the box or printed on the label. If the infested person has very long hair (longer than shoulder length), it may be necessary to use a second bottle. Pay special attention to instructions on the label or in the box regarding how long the medication should be left on the hair and how it should be washed out.
 
       
       
        
       
       
    - Have the infested person put on clean clothing after treatment. 
    - If a few live lice are still found 8–12 hours after treatment, but are moving more slowly than before, do not retreat. The medicine may take longer to kill all the lice. Comb dead and any remaining live lice out of the hair using a fine–toothed nit comb. 
    - If, after 8–12 hours of treatment, no dead lice are found and lice seem as active as before, the medicine may not be working. Do not retreat until speaking with your health care provider; a different pediculicide may be necessary. If your health care provider recommends a different pediculicide, carefully follow the treatment instructions contained in the box or printed on the label. 
    - Nit (head lice egg) combs, often found in lice medicine packages, should be used to comb nits and lice from the hair shaft. Many flea combs made for cats and dogs are also effective. 
    - After each treatment, checking the hair and combing with a nit comb to remove nits and lice every 2–3 days may decrease the chance of self–reinfestation. Continue to check for 2–3 weeks to be sure all lice and nits are gone. Nit removal is not needed when treating with spinosad topical suspension. 
    - Retreatment is meant to kill any surviving hatched lice before they produce new eggs. For some drugs, retreatment is recommended routinely about a week after the first treatment (7–9 days, depending on the drug) and for others only if crawling lice are seen during this period. Retreatment with lindane shampoo is not recommended. 
    
     
   
Supplemental Measures: Head lice do not survive long if they fall off a person and cannot feed. You don't need to spend a lot of time or money on housecleaning activities. Follow these steps to help avoid re–infestation by lice that have recently fallen off the hair or crawled onto clothing or furniture. 
    
    -  
Machine wash and dry clothing, bed linens, and other items that the infested person wore or used during the 2 days before treatment using the hot water (130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. Clothing and items that are not washable can be dry–cleaned 
OR 
sealed in a plastic bag and stored for 2 weeks.  
    - Soak combs and brushes in hot water (at least 130°F) for 5–10 minutes. 
    - Vacuum the floor and furniture, particularly where the infested person sat or lay. However, the risk of getting infested by a louse that has fallen onto a rug or carpet or furniture is very low. Head lice survive less than 1–2 days if they fall off a person and cannot feed; nits cannot hatch and usually die within a week if they are not kept at the same temperature as that found close to the human scalp. Spending much time and money on housecleaning activities is not necessary to avoid reinfestation by lice or nits that may have fallen off the head or crawled onto furniture or clothing. 
    - Do not use fumigant sprays; they can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin.

 Brand name product: Ulesfia lotion* 
Benzyl alcohol is an aromatic alcohol. Benzyl alcohol lotion, 5% has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of head lice and is considered safe and effective when used as directed. It kills lice but it is not ovicidal(i.e., does not kill lice eggs). A second treatment is needed 9 days after the first treatment to kill any newly hatched lice before they can produce new eggs. Benzyl alcohol lotion is intended for use on persons who are 6 months of age and older and its safety in persons aged more 60 years has not been established. It can be irritating to the skin.  
    -  
Ivermectin lotion, 0.5%;
 Brand name product: Sklice* 
Ivermectin lotion, 0.5% was approved by the FDA in 2012 for treatment of head lice in persons 6 months of age and older. It is not ovicidal, but appears to prevent nymphs (newly hatched lice) from surviving. It is effective in most patients when given as a single application on dry hair without nit combing. It should not be used for retreatment without talking to a healthcare provider. 
Given as a tablet in mass drug administrations, oral ivermectin has been used extensively and safely for over two decades in many countries to treat filarial worm infections. Although not FDA-approved for the treatment of lice, ivermectin tablets given in a single oral dose of 200 micrograms/kg repeated in 10 days or 400 micrograms/kg repeated in 7 days has been shown effective against head lice. It should not be used in children weighing less than 15 kg or in pregnant women.

 Brand name product: Natroba* 
Spinosad is derived from soil bacteria. Spinosad topical suspension, 0.9%, was approved by the FDA in 2011. Since it kills live lice as well as unhatched eggs, retreatment is usually not needed. Nit combing is not required. Spinosad topical suspension is approved for the treatment of children 6 months of age and older. It is safe and effective when used as directed. Repeat treatment should be given only if live (crawling) lice are seen 7 days after the first treatment.  
    
   
For second–line treatment only: 
    
    -  
Lindane shampoo 1%;
 Brand name products: None available 
Lindane is an organochloride. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) no longer recommends it as a pediculocide. Although lindane shampoo 1% is approved by the FDA for the treatment of head lice, it is not recommended as a first–line treatment. Overuse, misuse, or accidentally swallowing lindane can be toxic to the brain and other parts of the nervous system; its use should be restricted to patients for whom prior treatments have failed or who cannot tolerate other medications that pose less risk. Lindane should not be used to treat premature infants, persons with HIV, a seizure disorder, women who are pregnant or breast–feeding, persons who have very irritated skin or sores where the lindane will be applied, infants, children, the elderly, and persons who weigh less than 110 pounds. Retreatment should be avoided.  
    
   
 
   
When treating head lice 
    
    - Do not use extra amounts of any lice medication unless instructed to do so by your physician or pharmacist. The drugs used to treat lice are insecticides and can be dangerous if they are misused or overused. 
    - All the medications listed above should be kept out of the eyes. If they get onto the eyes, they should be immediately flushed away. 
    - Do not treat an infested person more than 2–3 times with the same medication if it does not seem to be working. This may be caused by using the medicine incorrectly or by resistance to the medicine. Always seek the advice of your health care provider if this should happen. He/she may recommend an alternative medication. 
    - Do not use different head lice drugs at the same time unless instructed to do so by your physician or pharmacist.

Reducing exposure to mosquito bites is the best defense against getting infected with LACV or other mosquito-borne viruses. There are several approaches you and your family can use to prevent and control mosquito-borne diseases. 
 
 - Use repellent: When outdoors, use insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin as well as on clothing (mosquitoes will bite through thin cloth). 
   
   - Permethrin is a repellent/insecticide that can be applied to clothing and will provide excellent protection through multiple washes. You can treat clothing yourself (always follow the directions on the package!) or purchase pre-treated clothing. For best protection it is still necessary to apply other repellent to exposed skin.  
    
 - Wear protective clothing: Wear long sleeves, pants and socks when weather permits. 
 - Avoid peak biting hours: Avoid outdoor activity or use protective measures when mosquitoes are active (Aedes triseriatus mosquitoes are most active during daytime—from dawn until dusk). 
 - Install and repair screens: Have secure, intact screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out.  
 - Keep mosquitoes from laying eggs near you: Mosquitoes can lay eggs even in small amounts of standing water. While Aedes triseriatus prefers treeholes, it will also lay eggs in artificial containers. You can fill treeholes in/around your yard with soil. Get rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower pots, buckets, barrels, and tires. Change the water in pet dishes and replace the water in bird baths weekly. Drill holes in tire swings so water drains out. Empty children's wading pools and store on their side after use.

    Fact Sheets","
Toxocariasis is a parasitic infection caused by roundworms, specifically the species Toxocara canis or Toxocara cati. These roundworms are not nematodes but belong to the family Ascarididae. The infection is usually contracted by ingesting soil or objects contaminated with infected dog or cat feces. Symptoms vary widely, but can include fever, cough, rash, and in severe cases, damage to organs such as the eyes or brain."

Once in the environment, it takes 2 to 4 weeks for Toxocara larvae to develop and for the eggs to become infectious. Humans or other animals can be infected by accidentally ingesting Toxocara eggs. For example, humans can become infected if they work with dirt and accidentally ingest dirt containing Toxocara eggs. Although rare, people can be infected by eating undercooked or raw meat from an infected animal such as a lamb or rabbit. Because dogs and cats are frequently found where people live, there may be large numbers of infected eggs in the environment. Once in the body, the Toxocara eggs hatch and roundworm larvae can travel in the bloodstream to different parts of the body, including the liver, heart, lungs, brain, muscles, or eyes. Most infected people do not have any symptoms. However, in some people, the Toxocara larvae can cause damage to these tissues and organs. The symptoms of toxocariasis, the disease caused by these migrating larvae, include fever, coughing, inflammation of the liver, or eye problems.
    
A U.S. study in 1996 showed that 30% of dogs younger than 6 months deposit Toxocara eggs in their feces; other studies have shown that almost all puppies are born already infected with Toxocara canis. Research also suggests that 25% of all cats are infected with Toxocara cati. Infection rates are higher for dogs and cats that are left outside for more time and allowed to eat other animals. In humans, it has been found that almost 14% of the U.S. population has been infected with Toxocara. Globally, toxocariasis is found in many countries, and prevalence rates can reach as high as 40% or more in parts of the world. There are several factors that have been associated with higher rates of infection with Toxocara. People are more likely to be infected with Toxocara if they own a dog. Children and adolescents under the age of 20 are more likely to test positive for Toxocara infection. This may be because children are more likely to eat dirt and play in outdoor environments, such as sandboxes, where dog and cat feces can be found. This infection is more common in people living in poverty. Geographic location plays a role as well, because Toxocara is more prevalent in hot, humid regions where eggs are kept viable in the soil.","People of any age can be at risk for Toxocariasis (Roundworm Infection), but it is more common in children who may accidentally ingest soil or sand contaminated with roundworm eggs, and in people who have a weakened immune system."

There are several things that you can do around your home to make you and your pets safer:
    
     - Clean your pet’s living area at least once a week. Feces should be either buried or bagged and disposed of in the trash. Wash your hands after handling pet waste.
     - Do not allow children to play in areas that are soiled with pet or other animal feces and cover sandboxes when not in use to make sure that animals do not get inside and contaminate them.
     - Wash your hands with soap and warm water after playing with your pets or other animals, after outdoor activities, and before handling food.
     - Teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection.
     - Teach children that it is dangerous to eat dirt or soil.
    
    
More on: Handwashing
    
Toxocara eggs have a strong protective layer which makes the eggs able to survive in the environment for months or even years under the right conditions. Many common disinfectants are not effective against Toxocara eggs but extreme heat has been shown to kill the eggs. Prompt removal of animal feces can help prevent infection since the eggs require 2 to 4 weeks to become infective once they are out of the animal.","
To prevent Toxocariasis, one can take DEC preventively, reduce the number of carrier insects in a particular area, avoid mosquito bites with insecticides and insect repellents, wear protective clothing, use bed netting, maintain proper hand washing techniques and hygiene, and avoid eating uncooked fish, plants, or animals from potentially infected waters."

Acanthamoeba keratitis is a rare disease that can affect anyone, but is most common in individuals who wear contact lenses. In the United States, an estimated 85% of cases occur in contact lens users. The incidence of the disease in developed countries is approximately one to 33 cases per million contact lens wearers.
   
For people who wear contact lenses, certain practices can increase the risk of getting Acanthamoeba keratitis:
   
    - Storing and handling lenses improperly
    - Disinfecting lenses improperly (such as using tap water or topping off solutions when cleaning the lenses or lens case)
    - Swimming, using a hot tub, or showering while wearing lenses
    - Coming into contact with contaminated water
    - Having a history of trauma to the cornea

For infected persons who do become ill, onset of symptoms usually occurs 8-13 days after exposure to the virus as part of a biphasic febrile illness. This initial phase, which may last as long as a week, typically begins with any or all of the following symptoms: fever, malaise, lack of appetite, muscle aches, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms appearing less frequently include sore throat, cough, joint pain, chest pain, testicular pain, and parotid (salivary gland) pain. 
                
Following a few days of recovery, a second phase of illness may occur. Symptoms may consist of meningitis (fever, headache, stiff neck, etc.), encephalitis (drowsiness, confusion, sensory disturbances, and/or motor abnormalities, such as paralysis), or meningoencephalitis (inflammation of both the brain and meninges). LCMV has also been known to cause acute hydrocephalus (increased fluid on the brain), which often requires surgical shunting to relieve increased intracranial pressure. In rare instances, infection results in myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord) and presents with symptoms such as muscle weakness, paralysis, or changes in body sensation. An association between LCMV infection and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscles) has been suggested. 
                
Previous observations show that most patients who develop aseptic meningitis or encephalitis due to LCMV survive. No chronic infection has been described in humans, and after the acute phase of illness, the virus is cleared from the body. However, as in all infections of the central nervous system, particularly encephalitis, temporary or permanent neurological damage is possible. Nerve deafness and arthritis have been reported. 
                
Women who become infected with LCMV during pregnancy may pass the infection on to the fetus. Infections occurring during the first trimester may result in fetal death and pregnancy termination, while in the second and third trimesters, birth defects can develop. Infants infected In utero can have many serious and permanent birth defects, including vision problems, mental retardation, and hydrocephaly (water on the brain).

Rarely, pet rodents may become infected with LCMV from wild rodents. Breeders, pet stores, and pet owners should take measures to prevent infestations of wild rodents. Pet rodents should not come into contact with wild rodents. If you have a pet rodent, wash your hands with soap and water (or waterless alcohol-based hand rubs when soap is not available and hands are not visibly soiled) after handling rodents or their cages and bedding. 
                
If you have a rodent infestation in and around your home, take the following precautions to reduce the risk of LCMV infection: 
 
 - Seal up rodent entry holes or gaps with steel wool, lath metal, or caulk. 
 - Trap rats and mice by using an appropriate snap trap. 
 - Clean up rodent food sources and nesting sites and take precautions when cleaning rodent-infected areas: 
   
   - Use cross-ventilation when entering a previously unventilated enclosed room or dwelling prior to cleanup. 
   - Put on rubber, latex, vinyl or nitrile gloves. 
   - Do not stir up dust by vacuuming, sweeping, or any other means. 
   - Thoroughly wet contaminated areas with a bleach solution or household disinfectant. 
   - Hypochlorite (bleach) solution: Mix 1 and 1/2 cups of household bleach in 1 gallon of water. 
   - Once everything is wet, take up contaminated materials with damp towel and then mop or sponge the area with bleach solution or household disinfectant. 
   - Spray dead rodents with disinfectant and then double-bag along with all cleaning materials and throw bag out in an appropriate waste disposal system.

The geographic distributions of the rodent hosts are widespread both domestically and abroad. However, infrequent recognition and diagnosis, and historic underreporting of LCM, have limited scientists' ability to estimate incidence rates and prevalence of disease among humans. Understanding the epidemiology of LCM and LCMV infections will help to further delineate risk factors for infection and develop effective preventive strategies. Increasing physician awareness will improve disease recognition and reporting, which may lead to better characterization of the natural history and the underlying immunopathological mechanisms of disease, and stimulate future therapeutic research and development.","

A person with an adult tapeworm, which lives in the person’s gut, sheds eggs in the stool.  The infection with the adult tapeworm is called taeniasis.  A pig then eats the eggs in the stool.  The eggs develop into larvae inside the pig and form cysts (called cysticerci) in the pig's muscles or other tissues. The infection with the cysts is called cysticercosis. Humans who eat undercooked or raw infected pork swallow the cysts in the meat. The larvae then come out of their cysts in the human gut and develop into adult tapeworms, completing the cycle.
    
People get cysticercosis when they swallow eggs that are excreted in the stool of people with the adult tapeworm. This may happen when people
    
     - Drink water or eat food contaminated with tapeworm eggs
     - Put contaminated fingers in their mouth
    
    
Cysticercosis is not spread by eating undercooked meat. However, people get infected with tapeworms (taeniasis) by eating undercooked infected pork. People who have tapeworm infections can infect themselves with the eggs and develop cysticercosis (this is called autoinfection). They can also infect other people if they have poor hygiene and contaminate food or water that other people swallow. People who live with someone who has a tapeworm infection in their intestines have a much higher risk of getting cysticercosis than other people.
    
Human cysticercosis is found worldwide, especially in areas where pig cysticercosis is common. Both taeniasis and cysticercosis are most often found in rural areas of developing countries with poor sanitation, where pigs roam freely and eat human feces. Taeniasis and cysticercosis are rare among persons who live in countries where pigs are not raised and in countries where pigs do not have contact with human feces. Although uncommon, cysticercosis can occur in people who have never traveled outside of the United States if they are exposed to tapeworm eggs.

Diagnosis of cysticercosis, a parasitic infection caused by the larval form of the tapeworm Taenia solium, can be challenging due to the varied clinical presentation and the need for specific diagnostic tests.

The most reliable method for diagnosing cysticercosis is through imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound. These tests can help identify the presence of cysticerci (the larval form of the parasite) in various tissues, including the brain, muscles, and eyes.

Serological tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot, can also be used to detect antibodies against the parasite in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid. However, these tests may produce false negatives in cases where the infection is recent or the number of cysticerci is low.

In some cases, a definitive diagnosis may require the removal of cysticerci for microscopic examination. This is typically done through surgery or biopsy, but it carries risks and should be performed only when necessary.

If you suspect cysticercosis, consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. In cases of neurological involvement, it is essential to seek immediate medical attention, as the infection can cause severe complications if left untreated."

Treatment for Cysticercosis, a parasitic infection caused by Taenia solium, depends on the size and location of the cysts, as well as the symptoms they are producing. Anti-parasitic medications such as albendazole or praziquantel are commonly used. However, it's important to note that examination of aspirated cyst fluid for parasites can carry the danger of a fatal allergic reaction. To decrease the risk of allergic complications and the spread during the procedure, treatment with anti-parasitic medications before aspiration is recommended.

In addition to medication, surgical removal of cysts and/or surrounding tissue may be necessary for severe cases. The prognosis for heavy parasitic infestations is poor.

Prevention of Cysticercosis primarily involves reducing the number of carrier insects in a particular area, taking DEC preventively, and avoiding mosquito bites with insecticides, insect repellents, protective clothing, and bed netting.

In addition to the measures mentioned in the context, such as boiling or purifying drinking water, avoiding raw or undercooked fish or salads made from fresh aquatic plants, and controlling or eradicating snails that serve as intermediate hosts for lung or liver flukes, there are a few more steps to prevent diseases caused by marine toxins:

1. Regularly check for algae blooms in coastal waters, as they can indicate the presence of toxin-producing organisms.
2. Avoid consuming shellfish from closed shellfish beds, as these have been closed by law due to elevated toxin levels.
3. If you suspect you have consumed contaminated shellfish, report it to public health officials immediately.
4. Stay informed about local advisories and warnings regarding shellfish consumption in your area.
5. Cooking shellfish does not prevent PSP, so it's essential to avoid consuming raw or undercooked shellfish during the months when PSP is most common (May through November).
6. If you have any concerns about the safety of shellfish, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional or public health official."

Infection with Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, and S. japonicum causes illness in humans; less commonly, S. mekongi and S. intercalatum can cause disease. Although the worms that cause schistosomiasis are not found in the United States, more than 200 million people are infected worldwide.","
Parasites are organisms that live on or inside an animal of a different species and feed on it or draw nutrients from it. One example of a parasitic disease is Schistosomiasis, which is caused by parasitic flatworms called Schistosomes. These worms are found in freshwater snails and can infect humans when they come into contact with contaminated water. The infection can cause symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, and if left untreated, can lead to more severe complications like liver damage, anemia, and even death.

Schistosomiasis has several stages in its life cycle. The miracidium stage is the free-swimming larval form that hatches from the egg and infects the snail host. The sporocyst stage develops within the snail, and the cercariae are released into the water. When a human comes into contact with the water, the cercariae can penetrate the skin and transform into schistosomula, which migrate through the body and eventually settle in the blood vessels of the liver, intestines, or bladder, where they mature into adult worms and lay eggs. The eggs are excreted in the urine or feces, and if they come into contact with fresh water, they can hatch and reinfect other snails, continuing the life cycle.

To treat Schistosomiasis, medications such as praziquantel are commonly used. It is important to consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment. Prevention measures include avoiding contact with contaminated water, wearing protective clothing when swimming, and using water filtration systems."

More on: Resources for Health Professionals: Diagnosis","
To diagnose Schistosomiasis, microscopic examination of the patient's urine, stool, or tissue samples is typically required to detect the presence of the parasite's eggs or the parasite itself. In some cases, the absence of microfilariae in the bloodstream does not necessarily mean that the person is not infected, so examining other bodily fluids may be necessary. It is also important to note that people who have been infected for a long time may not have microfilariae in their bloodstream, making the diagnosis more challenging.

In addition, there are various diagnostic tests available for Schistosomiasis, such as the circulating cathodic antigen (C-CAA) test, which detects the presence of the parasite's eggs in the bloodstream, and the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test, which detects antibodies produced by the immune system in response to the parasite. These tests can be helpful in confirming a diagnosis of Schistosomiasis.

No vaccine is available.
    
The best way to prevent schistosomiasis is to take the following steps if you are visiting or live in an area where schistosomiasis is transmitted:
    
     - Avoid swimming or wading in freshwater when you are in countries in which schistosomiasis occurs. Swimming in the ocean and in chlorinated swimming pools is safe.
     - Drink safe water. Although schistosomiasis is not transmitted by swallowing contaminated water, if your mouth or lips come in contact with water containing the parasites, you could become infected. Because water coming directly from canals, lakes, rivers, streams, or springs may be contaminated with a variety of infectious organisms, you should either bring your water to a rolling boil for 1 minute or filter water before drinking it. Bring your water to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute will kill any harmful parasites, bacteria, or viruses present. Iodine treatment alone WILL NOT GUARANTEE that water is safe and free of all parasites.
     - Water used for bathing should be brought to a rolling boil for 1 minute to kill any cercariae, and then cooled before bathing to avoid scalding. Water held in a storage tank for at least 1 - 2 days should be safe for bathing.
     - Vigorous towel drying after an accidental, very brief water exposure may help to prevent the Schistosoma parasite from penetrating the skin. However, do not rely on vigorous towel drying alone to prevent schistosomiasis.
    
    
Those who have had contact with potentially contaminated water overseas should see their health care provider after returning from travel to discuss testing.
    
More on: Schistosomiasis in Travelers
   
  
  
   Control
   
In countries where schistosomiasis causes significant disease, control efforts usually focus on:
   
    - reducing the number of infections in people and/or
    - eliminating the snails that are required to maintain the parasite’s life cycle.
   
   
For all species that cause schistosomiasis, improved sanitation could reduce or eliminate transmission of this disease. In some areas with lower transmission levels, elimination of schistosomiasis is considered a ""winnable battle"" by public health officials.
   
Control measures can include mass drug treatment of entire communities and targeted treatment of school-age children. Some of the problems with control of schistosomiasis include:
   
    - Chemicals used to eliminate snails in freshwater sources may harm other species of animals in the water and, if treatment is not sustained, the snails may return to those sites afterwards.
    - For certain species of the parasite, such as S. japonicum, animals such as cows or water buffalo can also be infected. Runoff from pastures (if the cows are infected) can contaminate freshwater sources.","
To prevent Schistosomiasis, also known as Bilharzia, the following methods are recommended:

1. Avoid contact with contaminated water: This includes swimming, wading, or washing in freshwater lakes, rivers, or streams where the parasite is present.

2. Wear protective clothing: If you must be in contact with potentially contaminated water, wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and shoes.

3. Use skin protection: Apply an effective insect repellent to exposed skin and consider using waterproof repellent on clothing.

4. Boil water: If you collect water for drinking, boil it for at least 1 minute to kill the parasite.

5. Practice good hygiene: Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom, before handling food, and after contact with water.

6. Seek medical advice: If you have traveled to an area where Schistosomiasis is common and have symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, or rash, consult a healthcare professional.

7. Praziquantel: In areas where Schistosomiasis is prevalent, Praziquantel is often distributed as a preventative medication. Consult local health authorities for more information on preventative treatment options."

Head lice are not known to transmit disease; however, secondary bacterial infection of the skin resulting from scratching can occur with any lice infestation.
    
Getting head lice is not related to cleanliness of the person or his or her environment.
    
Head lice are mainly spread by direct contact with the hair of an infested person. The most common way to get head lice is by head-to-head contact with a person who already has head lice. Such contact can be common among children during play at:
    
     - school,
     - home, and
     - elsewhere (e.g., sports activities, playgrounds, camp, and slumber parties).
    
    
Uncommonly, transmission may occur by:
    
     - wearing clothing, such as hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms, or hair ribbons worn by an infested person;
     - using infested combs, brushes or towels; or
     - lying on a bed, couch, pillow, carpet, or stuffed animal that has recently been in contact with an infested person.
    
    
Reliable data on how many people get head lice each year in the United States are not available; however, an estimated 6 million to 12 million infestations occur each year in the United States among children 3 to 11 years of age. Some studies suggest that girls get head lice more often than boys, probably due to more frequent head-to-head contact.
    
In the United States, infestation with head lice is much less common among African-Americans than among persons of other races. The head louse found most frequently in the United States may have claws that are better adapted for grasping the shape and width of some types of hair but not others.","
People at risk for head lice include children, particularly those who attend school or daycare, as well as adults who have close contact with an infected person. Head lice spread mainly by direct head-to-head contact with an infested person. Sharing personal items such as hats, combs, brushes, or towels can also spread head lice."

Because adult and nymph lice are very small, move quickly, and avoid light, they may be difficult to find. Use of a fine-toothed louse comb may facilitate identification of live lice.
    
If crawling lice are not seen, finding nits attached firmly within ¼ inch of the base of hair shafts suggests, but does not confirm, the person is infested. Nits frequently are seen on hair behind the ears and near the back of the neck. Nits that are attached more than ¼ inch from the base of the hair shaft are almost always non-viable (hatched or dead). Head lice and nits can be visible with the naked eye, although use of a magnifying lens may be necessary to find crawling lice or to identify a developing nymph inside a viable nit. Nits are often confused with other particles found in hair such as dandruff, hair spray droplets, and dirt particles.
    
If no nymphs or adults are seen, and the only nits found are more than ¼ inch from the scalp, then the infestation is probably old and no longer active — and does not need to be treated.","
Diagnosis of head lice is usually done by visual inspection. Look for nits (eggs) or live lice on the scalp, behind the ears, and at the back of the neck. Nits are tiny, teardrop-shaped eggs that are attached to the hair shaft. They are often harder to spot than live lice, as they are glued to the hair and can be mistaken for dandruff. However, they are usually found closer to the scalp than dandruff. If you find live lice, they are usually moving quickly and can be seen crawling through the hair. It's important to note that head lice do not jump or fly, but they can easily spread from person to person through direct head-to-head contact. In some cases, a fine-toothed comb can be used to help detect lice and nits. If you suspect you or someone else has head lice, consult a healthcare provider for confirmation and treatment options."

Treatment for head lice is recommended for persons diagnosed with an active infestation. All household members and other close contacts should be checked; those persons with evidence of an active infestation should be treated. Some experts believe prophylactic treatment is prudent for persons who share the same bed with actively-infested individuals. All infested persons (household members and close contacts) and their bedmates should be treated at the same time. 
   
Some pediculicides (medicines that kill lice) have an ovicidal effect (kill eggs). For pediculicides that are only weakly ovicidal or not ovicidal, routine retreatment is recommended. For those that are more strongly ovicidal, retreatment is recommended only if live (crawling) lice are still present several days after treatment (see recommendation for each medication). To be most effective, retreatment should occur after all eggs have hatched but before new eggs are produced. 
   
When treating head lice, supplemental measures can be combined with recommended medicine (pharmacologic treatment); however, such additional (non-pharmacologic) measures generally are not required to eliminate a head lice infestation. For example, hats, scarves, pillow cases, bedding, clothing, and towels worn or used by the infested person in the 2-day period just before treatment is started can be machine washed and dried using the hot water and hot air cycles because lice and eggs are killed by exposure for 5 minutes to temperatures greater than 53.5°C (128.3°F). Items that cannot be laundered may be dry-cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag for two weeks. Items such as hats, grooming aids, and towels that come in contact with the hair of an infested person should not be shared. Vacuuming furniture and floors can remove an infested person's hairs that might have viable nits attached. 
     
   
Treatment of the infested person(s): Requires using an Over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medication. Follow these treatment steps: 
    
    - Before applying treatment, it may be helpful to remove clothing that can become wet or stained during treatment. 
    - Apply lice medicine, also called pediculicide, according to the instructions contained in the box or printed on the label. If the infested person has very long hair (longer than shoulder length), it may be necessary to use a second bottle. Pay special attention to instructions on the label or in the box regarding how long the medication should be left on the hair and how it should be washed out.
 
       
       
        
       
       
    - Have the infested person put on clean clothing after treatment. 
    - If a few live lice are still found 8–12 hours after treatment, but are moving more slowly than before, do not retreat. The medicine may take longer to kill all the lice. Comb dead and any remaining live lice out of the hair using a fine–toothed nit comb. 
    - If, after 8–12 hours of treatment, no dead lice are found and lice seem as active as before, the medicine may not be working. Do not retreat until speaking with your health care provider; a different pediculicide may be necessary. If your health care provider recommends a different pediculicide, carefully follow the treatment instructions contained in the box or printed on the label. 
    - Nit (head lice egg) combs, often found in lice medicine packages, should be used to comb nits and lice from the hair shaft. Many flea combs made for cats and dogs are also effective. 
    - After each treatment, checking the hair and combing with a nit comb to remove nits and lice every 2–3 days may decrease the chance of self–reinfestation. Continue to check for 2–3 weeks to be sure all lice and nits are gone. Nit removal is not needed when treating with spinosad topical suspension. 
    - Retreatment is meant to kill any surviving hatched lice before they produce new eggs. For some drugs, retreatment is recommended routinely about a week after the first treatment (7–9 days, depending on the drug) and for others only if crawling lice are seen during this period. Retreatment with lindane shampoo is not recommended. 
    
     
   
Supplemental Measures: Head lice do not survive long if they fall off a person and cannot feed. You don't need to spend a lot of time or money on housecleaning activities. Follow these steps to help avoid re–infestation by lice that have recently fallen off the hair or crawled onto clothing or furniture. 
    
    -  
Machine wash and dry clothing, bed linens, and other items that the infested person wore or used during the 2 days before treatment using the hot water (130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. Clothing and items that are not washable can be dry–cleaned 
OR 
sealed in a plastic bag and stored for 2 weeks.  
    - Soak combs and brushes in hot water (at least 130°F) for 5–10 minutes. 
    - Vacuum the floor and furniture, particularly where the infested person sat or lay. However, the risk of getting infested by a louse that has fallen onto a rug or carpet or furniture is very low. Head lice survive less than 1–2 days if they fall off a person and cannot feed; nits cannot hatch and usually die within a week if they are not kept at the same temperature as that found close to the human scalp. Spending much time and money on housecleaning activities is not necessary to avoid reinfestation by lice or nits that may have fallen off the head or crawled onto furniture or clothing. 
    - Do not use fumigant sprays; they can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin.

    - Do not use extra amounts of any lice medication unless instructed to do so by your physician or pharmacist. The drugs used to treat lice are insecticides and can be dangerous if they are misused or overused. 
    - All the medications listed above should be kept out of the eyes. If they get onto the eyes, they should be immediately flushed away. 
    - Do not treat an infested person more than 2–3 times with the same medication if it does not seem to be working. This may be caused by using the medicine incorrectly or by resistance to the medicine. Always seek the advice of your health care provider if this should happen. He/she may recommend an alternative medication. 
    - Do not use different head lice drugs at the same time unless instructed to do so by your physician or pharmacist.

Head lice, also known as pediculosis capitis, are small insects that live in human hair and feed on blood. Treatment typically involves the use of over-the-counter or prescription medications to kill the lice and their eggs. Some common treatments include:

1. Shampoos and lotions containing permethrin, pyrethrins, or malathion. These products are applied to the hair and scalp, left on for a specified amount of time, and then rinsed out.
2. Cream rinses containing lindane may also be used, but their use is less common due to potential side effects and concerns about resistance.
3. In some cases, prescription medications such as ivermethrin or spinosad may be necessary for treatment-resistant cases or for people with severe infestations.
4. In addition to medication, manual removal of lice and eggs (nits) from the hair using a fine-toothed comb is an important part of treatment to ensure all lice and eggs are removed.
5. It's also important to wash all bedding, clothing, and towels in hot water and dry them on high heat to kill any remaining lice and eggs.
6. Regularly cleaning combs, brushes, and other personal care items in hot water can also help prevent re-infestation.
7. Prevention measures include avoiding head-to-head contact, not sharing hats, combs, brushes, or towels, and using insecticides or insect repellents on the scalp.

If you find yourself dealing with a head lice infestation, it's important to seek treatment as soon as possible to prevent the infestation from spreading to others and to minimize discomfort and potential complications. If you have any concerns about the treatment options or if the infestation persists despite treatment, consult a healthcare professional for further guidance."

However, much less frequently they are spread by sharing clothing or belongings onto which lice have crawled or nits attached to shed hairs may have fallen. The risk of getting infested by a louse that has fallen onto a carpet or furniture is very small. Head lice survive less than 1–2 days if they fall off a person and cannot feed; nits cannot hatch and usually die within a week if they are not kept at the same temperature as that found close to the scalp.
    
The following are steps that can be taken to help prevent and control the spread of head lice:
    
     - Avoid head-to-head (hair-to-hair) contact during play and other activities at home, school, and elsewhere (sports activities, playground, slumber parties, camp).
     - Do not share clothing such as hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms, hair ribbons, or barrettes.
     - Do not share combs, brushes, or towels. Disinfest combs and brushes used by an infested person by soaking them in hot water (at least 130°F) for 5–10 minutes.
     - Do not lie on beds, couches, pillows, carpets, or stuffed animals that have recently been in contact with an infested person.
     - Machine wash and dry clothing, bed linens, and other items that an infested person wore or used during the 2 days before treatment using the hot water (130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. Clothing and items that are not washable can be dry-cleaned OR sealed in a plastic bag and stored for 2 weeks.
     - Vacuum the floor and furniture, particularly where the infested person sat or lay. However, spending much time and money on housecleaning activities is not necessary to avoid reinfestation by lice or nits that may have fallen off the head or crawled onto furniture or clothing.
     - Do not use fumigant sprays or fogs; they are not necessary to control head lice and can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
    
    
To help control a head lice outbreak in a community, school, or camp, children can be taught to avoid activities that may spread head lice.","
Prevention of head lice infestation can be achieved through several methods:

1. Personal Hygiene: Regular hair care, such as washing and conditioning hair, can help reduce the risk of head lice infestation.

2. Avoid Head-to-Head Contact: Minimizing head-to-head contact, especially with people who have head lice, can help prevent the spread of lice.

3. Not Sharing Personal Items: Sharing hats, combs, brushes, and other personal items that come into contact with the head should be avoided, as lice can be easily transferred from one person to another.

4. Checking for Lice Regularly: Regularly checking one's own hair and the hair of children for signs of lice can help catch an infestation early, allowing for prompt treatment.

5. Using Special Products: There are various lice-killing shampoos, sprays, and lotions available over the counter that can help kill lice and their eggs.

6. Cleaning Bedding and Clothing: If someone in the household has head lice, it's important to wash their bedding, clothing, and towels in hot water (at least 130°F or 54°C) and dry them on the highest heat setting for at least 20 minutes to kill any remaining lice or eggs.

7. Vacuuming: Regularly vacuuming furniture, carpeting, and upholstery can help remove lice and their eggs from the environment."

Reducing exposure to mosquito bites is the best defense against getting infected with LACV or other mosquito-borne viruses. There are several approaches you and your family can use to prevent and control mosquito-borne diseases. 
 
 - Use repellent: When outdoors, use insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin as well as on clothing (mosquitoes will bite through thin cloth). 
   
   - Permethrin is a repellent/insecticide that can be applied to clothing and will provide excellent protection through multiple washes. You can treat clothing yourself (always follow the directions on the package!) or purchase pre-treated clothing. For best protection it is still necessary to apply other repellent to exposed skin.  
    
 - Wear protective clothing: Wear long sleeves, pants and socks when weather permits. 
 - Avoid peak biting hours: Avoid outdoor activity or use protective measures when mosquitoes are active (Aedes triseriatus mosquitoes are most active during daytime—from dawn until dusk). 
 - Install and repair screens: Have secure, intact screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out.  
 - Keep mosquitoes from laying eggs near you: Mosquitoes can lay eggs even in small amounts of standing water. While Aedes triseriatus prefers treeholes, it will also lay eggs in artificial containers. You can fill treeholes in/around your yard with soil. Get rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower pots, buckets, barrels, and tires. Change the water in pet dishes and replace the water in bird baths weekly. Drill holes in tire swings so water drains out. Empty children's wading pools and store on their side after use.  
","
Answer: La Crosse Encephalitis is a viral infection that can cause inflammation in the brain. To prevent La Crosse Encephalitis, it is recommended to avoid exposure to mosquitoes, particularly during peak mosquito season (June to August in North America). You can do this by wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and using insect repellent containing DEET. Also, removing standing water from around your home can help reduce the mosquito population. However, there is no specific vaccine for La Crosse Encephalitis. If you suspect you have been exposed or are experiencing symptoms, consult a healthcare professional immediately."

    Fact Sheets","
Toxocariasis is a parasitic infection caused by roundworms of the species Toxocara canis (dog roundworm) or Toxocara cati (cat roundworm). These parasites are transmitted to humans when they ingest soil or objects contaminated with the eggs of the roundworms, often from contaminated sandboxes, play areas, or unwashed vegetables. Symptoms can vary greatly and may include fever, coughing, skin rash, and in severe cases, damage to organs such as the eyes, liver, and brain. If you suspect you have been infected, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment."

Once in the environment, it takes 2 to 4 weeks for Toxocara larvae to develop and for the eggs to become infectious. Humans or other animals can be infected by accidentally ingesting Toxocara eggs. For example, humans can become infected if they work with dirt and accidentally ingest dirt containing Toxocara eggs. Although rare, people can be infected by eating undercooked or raw meat from an infected animal such as a lamb or rabbit. Because dogs and cats are frequently found where people live, there may be large numbers of infected eggs in the environment. Once in the body, the Toxocara eggs hatch and roundworm larvae can travel in the bloodstream to different parts of the body, including the liver, heart, lungs, brain, muscles, or eyes. Most infected people do not have any symptoms. However, in some people, the Toxocara larvae can cause damage to these tissues and organs. The symptoms of toxocariasis, the disease caused by these migrating larvae, include fever, coughing, inflammation of the liver, or eye problems.
    
A U.S. study in 1996 showed that 30% of dogs younger than 6 months deposit Toxocara eggs in their feces; other studies have shown that almost all puppies are born already infected with Toxocara canis. Research also suggests that 25% of all cats are infected with Toxocara cati. Infection rates are higher for dogs and cats that are left outside for more time and allowed to eat other animals. In humans, it has been found that almost 14% of the U.S. population has been infected with Toxocara. Globally, toxocariasis is found in many countries, and prevalence rates can reach as high as 40% or more in parts of the world. There are several factors that have been associated with higher rates of infection with Toxocara. People are more likely to be infected with Toxocara if they own a dog. Children and adolescents under the age of 20 are more likely to test positive for Toxocara infection. This may be because children are more likely to eat dirt and play in outdoor environments, such as sandboxes, where dog and cat feces can be found. This infection is more common in people living in poverty. Geographic location plays a role as well, because Toxocara is more prevalent in hot, humid regions where eggs are kept viable in the soil.","
Toxocariasis, or roundworm infection, can affect people of any age, but it is more common in children who have not yet developed strong immune systems and in individuals with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or those undergoing chemotherapy. Pets, particularly dogs and cats, can also carry the roundworm larvae, and humans can contract the infection through contact with contaminated soil or accidentally ingesting contaminated food or water."

A blood test is available that looks for evidence of infection with Toxocara larvae. In addition to the blood test, diagnosis of toxocariasis includes identifying the presence of typical clinical signs of VT or OT and a history of exposure to cats and dogs.","
Diagnosis of Toxocariasis (Roundworm Infection) can be made by microscopic inspection of feces to reveal the presence of roundworm eggs. Additionally, visual inspection of the skin may reveal tell-tale itchy red lines and blisters. Blood tests can also be used to detect antibodies against the roundworm.

There are several things that you can do around your home to make you and your pets safer:
    
     - Clean your pet’s living area at least once a week. Feces should be either buried or bagged and disposed of in the trash. Wash your hands after handling pet waste.
     - Do not allow children to play in areas that are soiled with pet or other animal feces and cover sandboxes when not in use to make sure that animals do not get inside and contaminate them.

     - Teach children that it is dangerous to eat dirt or soil.
    
    
More on: Handwashing
    
Toxocara eggs have a strong protective layer which makes the eggs able to survive in the environment for months or even years under the right conditions. Many common disinfectants are not effective against Toxocara eggs but extreme heat has been shown to kill the eggs. Prompt removal of animal feces can help prevent infection since the eggs require 2 to 4 weeks to become infective once they are out of the animal.","
To prevent Parasites - Toxocariasis (Roundworm Infection), you can take DEC preventively as a measure, which has shown to be effective. Additionally, reducing the number of carrier insects in a particular area is beneficial. This can be achieved by avoiding mosquito bites with insecticides and insect repellents, wearing protective clothing, and using bed netting. Furthermore, it's essential to maintain proper hand washing techniques and hygiene, as the origin of the infection is primarily waterborne."

Acanthamoeba keratitis is a rare disease that can affect anyone, but is most common in individuals who wear contact lenses. In the United States, an estimated 85% of cases occur in contact lens users. The incidence of the disease in developed countries is approximately one to 33 cases per million contact lens wearers.
   
For people who wear contact lenses, certain practices can increase the risk of getting Acanthamoeba keratitis:
   
    - Storing and handling lenses improperly
    - Disinfecting lenses improperly (such as using tap water or topping off solutions when cleaning the lenses or lens case)
    - Swimming, using a hot tub, or showering while wearing lenses
    - Coming into contact with contaminated water
    - Having a history of trauma to the cornea

Diagnosis of Acanthamoeba - Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis (GAE) and Keratitis involves a combination of the patient's history, particularly any recent exposure or travel to environments that may harbor the amoeba, and laboratory tests. For GAE, the diagnosis is often based on a cerebrospinal fluid analysis (spinal tap) to detect the presence of the amoeba or its DNA, as well as blood tests to detect antibodies to the amoeba. For Keratitis, a corneal scraping or biopsy may be performed to identify the amoeba in the affected eye tissue. In some cases, culture or PCR tests may also be used to confirm the diagnosis. It is essential to consult an ophthalmologist for proper diagnosis and treatment of Keratitis."

Eating raw or undercooked beef or pork is the primary risk factor for acquiring taeniasis. Persons who don't eat raw or undercooked beef or pork are not likely to get taeniasis.
    
Infections with T. saginata occur wherever contaminated raw beef is eaten, particularly in Eastern Europe, Russia, eastern Africa and Latin America. Taeniasis due to T. saginata is rare in the United States, except in places where cattle and people are concentrated and sanitation is poor, such as around feed lots when cattle can be exposed to human feces. Tapeworm infections due to T. solium are more prevalent in under-developed communities with poor sanitation and where people eat raw or undercooked pork. Higher rates of illness have been seen in people in Latin America, Eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Asia. Taenia solium taeniasis is seen in the United States, typically among Latin American immigrants. Taenia asiatica is limited to Asia and is seen mostly in the Republic of Korea, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Thailand.
    
A disease called cysticercosis can occur when T. solium tapeworm eggs are ingested. For example, people with poor hygiene who have taeniasis -- with or without symptoms -- will shed tapeworm eggs in their feces and might accidentally contaminate their environment. This can lead to transmission of cysticercosis to themselves or others.

Taeniasis, caused by tapeworm infection, is primarily contracted by eating raw or undercooked meat, particularly pork or beef, that contains tapeworm eggs. To prevent Taeniasis, follow these guidelines:

1. Cook meat thoroughly: Ensure that all meat is well-cooked before consumption, especially pork and beef.
2. Avoid raw or undercooked meat: Do not consume raw or undercooked meat, including meat that is pink in the middle.
3. Wash hands and utensils: After handling raw meat, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
4. Freeze meat: Freezing meat for at least 2 weeks at -20°C can kill tapeworm eggs.
5. Avoid consuming raw or undercooked fish: Raw fish, particularly fish that is not from a reliable source, can also carry tapeworms. Cook fish thoroughly before consumption.
6. Practice good personal hygiene: Maintain good personal hygiene, especially when handling and preparing food.
7. Wash fruits and vegetables: Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating, as they can potentially be contaminated with tapeworm eggs.
8. Avoid consuming contaminated water: Tapeworm eggs can be found in water contaminated with feces. Boil water before drinking, or use a water filter if available.

Raccoons become infected with Baylisascaris in one of two ways:
    
     - Young raccoons become infected by eating eggs during foraging, feeding, and grooming.
     - Adult raccoons acquire the infection by eating rodents, rabbits, and birds infected with the larvae of Baylisascaris.
    
    
Infected raccoons have been found throughout the United States, mainly in the Midwest, Northeast, Middle Atlantic, and West Coast.
    
Raccoons are peridomestic animals, which means they live in or around areas where people live. Roundworm eggs are passed in the feces of infected raccoons. Raccoons defecate in communal sites, called latrines. Raccoon latrines are often found at bases of trees, unsealed attics, or on flat surfaces such as logs, tree stumps, rocks, decks, and rooftops. As more raccoons move into populated areas, the number and density of their latrines will increase.
    
While raccoons are the roundworm's primary host, other types of animals can become infected. Birds and small mammals, such as rodents and rabbits, are susceptible to the parasite. Unlike raccoons, these animals sometimes show signs of infection, such as muscle spasms, tremors, and progressive weakness; infection can lead to death. Predator animals, including dogs, may become infected by eating an animal that has been infected with Baylisascaris. In some dogs, Baylisascaris may develop to adult worms and pass eggs in the dogs' feces.
    
The worms develop to maturity in the raccoon intestine, where they produce millions of eggs that are passed in the feces. Eggs that are excreted by raccoons are not immediately infectious. These eggs must develop in the environment for 2 to 4 weeks, after which the eggs are able to cause infection. The eggs are resistant to most environmental conditions and with adequate moisture, can survive for years.
    
     
    
    
Humans become infected by ingesting embryonated (fertile) eggs. Anyone who is exposed to environments where raccoons frequent is potentially at risk. Young children or developmentally disabled persons are at highest risk for infection as they may be more likely to put contaminated fingers, soil, or objects into their mouths.
    
Hunters, trappers, taxidermists, and wildlife handlers may also be at increased risk if they have contact with raccoons or raccoon habitats.
    
Fewer than 25 cases of Baylisascaris disease have been documented in the United States. However, it is possible that some cases are incorrectly diagnosed as other infections or go undiagnosed. Cases that are diagnosed tend to be severe.
    
Cases have been reported in California, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. As of 2012, there were 16 published human neurological cases in the US; six of the infected persons died.","

Be sure to tell your health care provider if you have recently been exposed to raccoons or their feces.
    
Diagnosis is difficult because symptoms depend on the number of infecting larvae and location in the body. Ocular larva migrans, when the larvae migrate to the eye, can cause sensitivity to light, inflammation of the eye, and blindness. Symptoms of visceral larva migrans, when the larvae travel to organs, depend on which organs are affected. For example, an invasion of the liver may cause hepatomegaly (inflammation and enlargement of the liver), while an invasion of the lung may cause pulmonary symptoms such as cough or chest pain. Larvae rarely end up in the nervous system but the most severe cases are neural larva migrans, when the larvae migrate into the brain and cause it to swell (encephalitis). There is no commercially available test for Baylisascaris infection. A health care provider may test blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tissue to determine if an individual is infected. Eye examinations may reveal a migrating larva or lesions and are often the most significant clue to infection with Baylisascaris.
    
Diagnosis often is made by ruling out other infections that cause similar symptoms. Information on diagnosis and testing can be obtained through your local or state health department or CDC.

Washing your hands after working or playing outdoors is good practice for preventing a number of diseases.
    
Do not keep, feed, or adopt wild animals, including raccoons, as pets. Infection rarely causes symptoms in raccoons, so you cannot tell if a raccoon is infected by observing its behavior. Roundworm eggs passed in the feces of infected raccoons are not visible to the naked eye. Eggs can only be seen using a microscope.
    
     
    
    
You may discourage raccoons from living in and around your home or parks by taking these steps:
    
     - prevent access to food
     - keep trash containers tightly closed
     - close off access to attics and basements
     - keep sandboxes covered when not in use (raccoons may use sandboxes as a latrine)
     - remove fish ponds -- they eat the fish and drink the water
     - eliminate water sources
     - remove bird feeders
     - clear brush so raccoons are not likely to make a den on your property
    
    
Stay away from areas and materials that might be contaminated by raccoon feces. Raccoons typically defecate at the base of or in raised forks of trees, or on raised horizontal surfaces such as fallen logs, stumps, or large rocks. Raccoon feces also can be found on woodpiles, decks, rooftops, and in attics, garages, and haylofts. Feces usually are dark and tubular, have a pungent odor (usually worse than dog or cat feces), and often contain undigested seeds or other food items.
    
If you have found a raccoon latrine near your home, cleaning the area may prevent possible infection. Newly deposited eggs take at least 2-4 weeks to become infective. Prompt removal and destruction of raccoon feces will reduce risk for exposure and possible infection.

If you choose to clean the site yourself, care should be taken to avoid contaminating hands and clothes.
    
     - Wear disposable gloves to help prevent cross contamination.
     - Wear a N95-rated respirator if working in a confined space to prevent accidental ingestion of eggs or other harmful materials.
     - Avoid stirring up dust and debris- you can lightly mist the latrine area with a little water from a spray bottle to reduce the amount of dust.
     - Wear rubber boots that can be scrubbed or cover your shoes with disposable booties that can be thrown away, so that you do not bring eggs into your household.
     - Feces and material contaminated with raccoon feces should be removed and burned, buried, or sent to a landfill.
     - Most chemicals do not kill roundworm eggs; however, heat kills the eggs instantly.
     - Treat feces-soiled decks, patios, and other surfaces with boiling water or a propane torch (please contact your local fire department for regulations and safety practices).
    
    
To help further reduce the risk of possible infection, wash your hands well with soap and warm running water. Clean/launder your clothes thoroughly with hot water and detergent.
    
More on: Handwashing
    
If you are cleaning an indoor raccoon latrine and are not able to use a propane torch, use a damp (but not wet) sponge to wipe the area with hot soapy water. Rinse your sponge frequently. After you are finished, flush dirty water down the toilet. Place the sponge in a plastic bag and put the plastic bag in the garbage.
    
Contact your local animal control office for additional assistance.
    Dogs
    
Dogs may be infected with adult B. procyonis roundworms, but may not show symptoms. Have all pets de-wormed under a veterinarian's supervision and take precautions to avoid contact with their feces.
    Exotic pets
    
Raccoons and dogs are not the only hosts of Baylisascaris. B. procyonis infection has also been documented in kinkajous. Other animals such as coatis may be susceptible. When wild animals are kept as pets, there can be a risk of disease transmission to humans.","
Parasites - Baylisascaris infection, also known as Baylisascaris procyonis, is a roundworm infection that is primarily transmitted through the feces of raccoons. There is no specific treatment for this infection, but preventive measures can be taken to reduce the risk of exposure.

1. Avoid contact with raccoon feces: Raccoons are the primary carriers of the parasite, so avoiding contact with their feces is essential. This includes not allowing pets to play in areas where raccoons may have defecated.

2. Wash hands thoroughly: If you come into contact with soil or objects that may have been contaminated with raccoon feces, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.

3. Cover any open wounds: If you have any open wounds on your skin, cover them with waterproof bandages to prevent direct contact with the parasite eggs.

4. Dispose of raccoon carcasses properly: If you find a dead raccoon, do not touch it with bare hands. Wear gloves and a mask, and contact your local animal control agency to dispose of the carcass safely.

5. Keep your pets safe: Keep your pets away from areas where raccoons are known to live or roam. If your pet has been in contact with raccoons, consult your veterinarian for advice on deworming treatments.

6. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the signs and symptoms of Baylisascaris infection in both humans and animals. Teach others, especially children, about the importance of avoiding contact with raccoons and their feces.

7. Report raccoon sightings: If you see raccoons in your neighborhood, report the sighting to your local animal control agency or health department. They can help manage the raccoon population and reduce the risk of infection."

Most human cases of Babesia infection in the United States are caused by the parasite Babesia microti. Occasional cases caused by other species (types) of Babesia have been detected. Babesia microti is spread in nature by Ixodes scapularis ticks (also called blacklegged ticks or deer ticks). Tickborne transmission is most common in particular regions and seasons: it mainly occurs in parts of the Northeast and upper Midwest; and it usually peaks during the warm months. Babesia infection can range in severity from asymptomatic to life threatening. The infection is both treatable and preventable.

Parasites, in the context provided, are organisms that live on or inside another animal of a different species and feed on it or draw nutrients from it. However, the term ""Babesiosis"" is not mentioned in the provided context. Babesiosis is a tick-borne disease caused by microscopic parasites called Babesia. These parasites infect red blood cells and can cause symptoms similar to malaria, such as fever, chills, and fatigue. For more detailed information about Babesiosis, you may want to consult a medical textbook or a reliable online resource."

     - The main way is through the bite of an infected tick—during outdoor activities in areas where babesiosis is found (see below).
     - A less common way is by getting a transfusion from a blood donor who has a Babesia infection but does not have any symptoms. (No tests have been licensed yet for screening blood donors for Babesia.)
     - Rare cases of congenital transmission—from an infected mother to her baby (during pregnancy or delivery)—have been reported.
    
    
Babesia parasites are not transmitted from person-to-person like the flu or the common cold.
    
Many different species (types) of Babesia parasites have been found in animals, only a few of which have been found in people. Babesia microti—which usually infects white-footed mice and other small mammals—is the main species that has been found in people in the United States. Occasional (sporadic) cases of babesiosis caused by other Babesia species have been detected.
    
     
    
    
Babesia microti is transmitted in nature by Ixodes scapularis ticks (also called blacklegged ticks or deer ticks).
    
     - Tickborne transmission primarily occurs in the Northeast and upper Midwest, especially in parts of New England, New York state, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.
     - The parasite typically is spread by the young nymph stage of the tick, which is most apt to be found (seeking or ""questing"" for a blood meal) during warm months (spring and summer), in areas with woods, brush, or grass.
     - Infected people might not recall a tick bite because I. scapularis nymphs are very small (about the size of a poppy seed).","
People at risk for Babesiosis include:

1. Individuals living in or traveling to areas where the black-legged tick, which carries the parasite, is found, such as the northeastern and upper midwestern United States, the Atlantic coast, and the Great Lakes region.
2. Immunocompromised individuals, such as those with weakened immune systems due to diseases like HIV/AIDS, organ transplants, or certain medications, as they may be more susceptible to the disease.
3. Pets, particularly dogs, can also contract the disease and potentially transmit it to humans.
4. People who have come into contact with infected ticks, either through outdoor activities or by having pets that bring ticks into the home.
5. Babies can also be at risk if they are breastfed by a mother who has been infected with the parasite."

To be sure the diagnosis is correct, your health care provider might have specimens of your blood tested by a specialized reference laboratory (such as at CDC or a health department).
    
More on: Resources for Health Professionals: Diagnosis","
To diagnose Babesiosis, a parasitic infection, the only sure way is by detecting the parasite itself, either the adult worms or the microfilariae. Microscopic examination of the person’s blood may reveal microfilariae. However, it's important to note that people who have been infected for a long time may not have microfilariae in their bloodstream. In these cases, examining the urine or hydrocele fluid may also be considered.

Since the absence of microfilariae in the bloodstream does not necessarily mean that the person is not infected, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis. They may perform additional tests, such as blood smear tests, PCR tests, or serological tests, to confirm the presence of Babesia parasites.

If you suspect you have been infected with Babesiosis, it is essential to seek medical attention promptly, as early treatment can significantly improve the chances of a favorable outcome. In the meantime, maintain proper hygiene and hand-washing techniques to help prevent the spread of the parasite."

More on: Resources for Health Professionals: Treatment","
Treatments for Babesiosis typically involve managing the symptoms as the current medications can only reduce the duration and severity of an acute infection, and are only effective in mild cases. In more severe cases, the prognosis is poor for heavy parasitic infestations. The primary treatment options include:

1. Antibiotics: Clindamycin or azithromycin are commonly used to treat Babesiosis.
2. Exchange transfusion: In severe cases, exchange transfusion may be necessary to remove the infected red blood cells from the body.
3. Intravenous immunoglobulin: In some cases, intravenous immunoglobulin may be administered to help boost the immune system's response to the infection.
4. Supportive care: This may include fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration, oxygen therapy to help with breathing, and blood pressure support if necessary.

It's important to note that the treatment of Babesiosis is most effective when started early, so prompt diagnosis is crucial. If you suspect you have been infected with Babesiosis, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

Prevention of Babesiosis primarily involves:

1. Preventive medication: Taking DEC (diethylcarbamazine) preventively can help reduce the risk of infection.
2. Mosquito control: Avoiding mosquito bites by using insecticides, insect repellents, wearing protective clothing, and using bed netting can help prevent transmission.
3. Reducing mosquito breeding sites: Efforts to clean and eliminate standing water in and around homes can help reduce the number of mosquitoes.

If you live in or travel to an area where Babesiosis is common, consider taking these precautions to protect yourself from infection."

The use of prevention measures is especially important for people at increased risk for severe babesiosis (for example, people who do not have a spleen). Avoiding exposure to tick habitats is the best defense.
   
Babesia microti is spread by Ixodes scapularis ticks, which are mostly found in wooded, brushy, or grassy areas, in certain regions and seasons. No vaccine is available to protect people against babesiosis. However, people who live, work, or travel in tick-infested areas can take simple steps to help protect themselves against tick bites and tickborne infections.
   
    
   
   
During outdoor activities in tick habitats, take precautions to keep ticks off the skin.
   
    - Walk on cleared trails and stay in the center of the trail, to minimize contact with leaf litter, brush, and overgrown grasses, where ticks are most likely to be found.
    - Minimize the amount of exposed skin, by wearing socks, long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt. Tuck the pant legs into the socks, so ticks cannot crawl up the inside of the pants. Wear light-colored clothing, to make it easier to see and remove ticks before they attach to skin.
    - Apply repellents to skin and clothing. Follow the instructions on the product label. 
     
      - Products that contain DEET (N,N-diethylmetatoluamide) can be directly applied to exposed skin and to clothing, to help keep ticks away (by repelling them). The product label includes details about how and where to apply the repellent, how often to reapply it, and how to use it safely on children.
      - Permethrin products can be applied to clothing/boots (not to skin), actually kill ticks that come in contact with the treated clothing, and usually stay effective through several washings.
     
   
   
    
   
   
After outdoor activities, conduct daily tick checks and promptly remove any ticks that are found. Thorough, daily tick checks are very important. The I. scapularis nymphs that typically spread B. microti are so small (about the size of a poppy seed) that they are easily overlooked. But they usually must stay attached to a person for more than 36-48 hours to be able to transmit the parasite.
   
    - Remove ticks from clothing and pets before going indoors.
    - Conduct a full-body exam for ticks. Use a hand-held or full-length mirror to view all parts of the body. Be sure to check behind the knees, between the legs (groin/thighs), between the toes, under the arms (armpits), around the waist, inside the belly button, the back of the neck, behind and in the ears, as well as in and around the scalp, hairline, and hair. Remember to check children and pets, too.
   
   
Remove ticks that are attached to the skin as soon as possible, preferably by using pointed (fine-tipped) tweezers. Grab the tick’s mouth parts close to the skin, and slowly pull the tick straight out (with steady outward pressure), until the tick lets go.

To prevent Babesiosis, the following measures can be taken:

1. DEC (Diethylcarbamazine) preventive treatment: This medication has shown to be effective in controlling the disease. Consult a healthcare professional for proper dosage and administration.

2. Reducing the number of carrier insects: This can be achieved by using insecticides and insect repellents to avoid mosquito bites. Wearing protective clothing and using bed netting is also recommended.

3. Good hygiene and nutrition: Maintaining good personal hygiene and a balanced diet can help strengthen the immune system and prevent recurrent infections.

4. Avoiding crowds or people with active infections: As Babesiosis is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick, it's essential to avoid contact with infected individuals, especially during peak tick season."

There may be also discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of bite, progressing within days to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, agitation. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, and insomnia.
                
The acute period of disease typically ends after 2 to 10 days. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive.
                
Disease prevention includes administration of both passive antibody, through an injection of human immune globulin and a round of injections with rabies vaccine.

Unvaccinated dogs, cats, and ferrets exposed to a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately. If the owner is unwilling to have this done, the animal should be placed in strict isolation for 6 months and vaccinated 1 month before being released.
  
Animals with expired vaccinations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Dogs and cats that are currently vaccinated are kept under observation for 45 days.
  
Small mammals such as squirrels, rats, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chipmunks, rabbits, and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to cause rabies among humans in the United States. Bites by these animals are usually not considered a risk of rabies unless the animal was sick or behaving in any unusual manner and rabies is widespread in your area.
  
However, from 1985 through 1994, woodchucks accounted for 86% of the 368 cases of rabies among rodents reported to CDC. Woodchucks or groundhogs (Marmota monax) are the only rodents that may be frequently submitted to state health department because of a suspicion of rabies. In all cases involving rodents, the state or local health department should be consulted before a decision is made to initiate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP).
  Is there rabies in my area?
  
Each state collects specific information about rabies, and is the best source for information on rabies in your area. In addition, the CDC publishes rabies surveillance data every year for the United States. The report, entitled Rabies Surveillance in the United States, contains information about the number of cases of rabies reported to CDC during the year, the animals reported rabid, maps showing where cases were reported for wild and domestic animals, and distribution maps showing outbreaks of rabies associated with specific animals.","
The risk for your pet to contract Rabies depends on the exposure to infected animals. Rabies is most often spread by animal bites from dogs, cats, mice, raccoons, squirrels, and bats. If your pet encounters any of these animals and gets bitten, there is a risk that your pet could contract Rabies. It is important to ensure your pet's vaccination against Rabies is up-to-date and to monitor your pet's interactions with wild animals. If your pet gets bitten by a wild animal, consult a veterinarian immediately."

Rabies can be diagnosed through a combination of methods, including:

1. Clinical signs: The presence of neurological symptoms such as anxiety, agitation, paralysis, and hydrophobia (fear of water) are often indicative of rabies.

2. Laboratory tests: These tests include direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing, which detects the rabies virus in the saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, or brain tissue, and the rabies antibody test, which checks for the presence of rabies antibodies in the blood.

3. Rabies vaccine challenge test (RVCT): In this test, a small amount of the rabies virus is introduced into the body, and if the person does not develop symptoms, it is assumed that they have pre-existing immunity from the rabies vaccine. This test is rarely used due to its high risk and is only performed in research settings.

4. Brain tissue examination: In cases where a person has died, a postmortem examination of the brain can confirm the presence of the rabies virus."

There are five main kinds of botulism. Foodborne botulism is caused by eating foods that contain the botulinum toxin. Wound botulism is caused by toxin produced from a wound infected with Clostridium botulinum. Infant botulism is caused by consuming the spores of the botulinum bacteria, which then grow in the intestines and release toxin. Adult intestinal toxemia (adult intestinal colonization) botulism is a very rare kind of botulism that occurs among adults by the same route as infant botulism. Lastly, iatrogenic botulism can occur from accidental overdose of botulinum toxin. All forms of botulism can be fatal and are considered medical emergencies. Foodborne botulism is a public health emergency because many people can be poisoned by eating a contaminated food.","
Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. It affects the nervous system, causing paralysis and potentially leading to death due to asphyxiation if the respiratory muscles are paralyzed. Symptoms include difficulty speaking, swallowing, and vision problems, with paralysis moving down the body.

Infant botulism, a form of botulism first recognized in 1976, occurs when a baby ingests spores of the bacterium, which then grow and produce toxins in the infant's intestines. Unlike other foodborne bacteria, C. botulinum is an anaerobic bacterium that can only live in the absence of oxygen and produces neurotoxins, which poison the nervous system, causing paralysis without vomiting or diarrhea associated with other foodborne illnesses. The toxins in adult botulism are released when the bacteria grows in an airless environment outside the body, but they can be broken down and made harmless under normal conditions.

People who show any signs of botulism poisoning must receive immediate emergency medical care to increase their chance of survival. Most people recover from botulism, although children who are malnourished or have weakened immune systems may experience complications and potentially die."

Antitoxin for infants is available from the California Department of Public Health, and antitoxin for older children and adults is available through CDC.If given before paralysis is complete, antitoxin can prevent worsening and shorten recovery time. Physicians may try to remove contaminated food still in the gut by inducing vomiting or by using enemas. Wounds should be treated, usually surgically, to remove the source of the toxin-producing bacteria followed by administration of appropriate antibiotics. Good supportive care in a hospital is the mainstay of therapy for all forms of botulism.","
Treatment for botulism involves supportive care in a hospital setting, as there is no specific antitoxin for the C. botulinum toxin. The primary goal is to prevent the spread of the toxin, support the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular functions, and manage symptoms such as muscle weakness. In some cases, a patient may require a ventilator to help with breathing. If the source of the contamination is known, it is essential to identify and eliminate it to prevent further exposure. In severe cases, an antitoxin may be administered to help neutralize the toxin that has already been absorbed. It is crucial to seek immediate medical attention if any symptoms of botulism are present, as prompt treatment can significantly improve the chances of recovery."

Foodborne botulism has often been from home-canned foods with low acid content, such as asparagus, green beans, beets and corn and is caused by failure to follow proper canning methods. However, seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade, with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture, at retail, or by consumers; some examples are chopped garlic in oil, canned cheese sauce, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice, and baked potatoes wrapped in foil. In Alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods. Persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods, and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners/cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the US Department of Agriculture. Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs. Most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust.  The bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.  Honey can contain the bacteria that causes infant botulism so, children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey. Honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and older.","
To prevent botulism, it's crucial to follow proper food preservation techniques, especially when canning or preserving low-acid foods like vegetables, meats, and fish. Here are some steps to help prevent botulism:

1. Use a pressure canner: High temperatures and pressure are necessary to kill C. botulinum spores in low-acid foods.
2. Process foods at the correct temperature and pressure: Follow the specific guidelines provided by the National Center for Home Food Preservation for the type of food and the type of canner you are using.
3. Check the seal: After canning, let the jars cool and check for a proper seal. If the lid is concave instead of convex, or if it doesn't pop when you press the center, the jar may not be sealed properly and should be refrigerated or reprocessed.
4. Store canned foods properly: Store canned foods in a cool, dry, dark place. Avoid storing them in a garage or basement where temperatures may fluctuate.
5. Discard suspicious canned foods: If you notice bulging or leaking cans, unusual odors, or mold growth, discard the food immediately.
6. Practice safe handling: Wash your hands and sanitize all equipment before canning. Avoid contaminating foods with raw meat juices.
7. Use fresh food: Use fresh food when canning, and avoid using food that has been stored for an extended period before canning.

For infant botulism, parents should avoid giving honey to infants under 12 months old, as it may contain spores of C. botulinum. If an infant shows symptoms of lethargy, constipation, or weak crying, seek immediate medical attention."

Information about safe canning is widely available for consumers. Persons in state health departments and at CDC are knowledgeable about botulism and available to consult with physicians 24 hours a day. If antitoxin is needed to treat a patient, it can be quickly delivered to a physician anywhere in the country. Suspected outbreaks of botulism are quickly investigated, and if they involve a commercial product, the appropriate control measures are coordinated among public health and regulatory agencies. Physicians should immediately report suspected cases of botulism to their state health department.

Public health agencies work to prevent or control botulism through education and regulation. They educate the public on good sanitation and food handling practices to prevent food poisoning, which is the primary cause of botulism. These practices include keeping hot foods hot and cold foods cold, cooking meat to the recommended internal temperature, and storing food properly to prevent bacterial growth.

In addition, public health agencies regulate food production and handling processes to ensure that food is safe for consumption. This includes monitoring food processing plants, inspecting food facilities, and enforcing food safety regulations. They also investigate outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, including botulism, to identify the source and prevent further cases.

If someone shows signs of botulism poisoning, they must receive immediate emergency medical care to increase their chance of survival. Infant botulism is a form of botulism that occurs when a baby ingests spores of C. botulinum, and public health agencies also work to educate parents and caregivers about the risks and prevention methods for infant botulism."

Marburg hemorrhagic fever (Marburg HF) is a severe viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Marburg virus. The diagnosis of Marburg HF can be challenging due to its rarity and non-specific early symptoms, which are similar to other viral infections. However, a careful and thorough evaluation is crucial to reach a diagnosis.

In the case of Marburg HF, the diagnosis is typically made based on clinical symptoms, epidemiological history, and laboratory tests. The patient's travel history, contact with animals (especially non-human primates), and exposure to infected individuals should be carefully assessed.

Laboratory tests for Marburg HF include:
1. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR): This test can detect the presence of the Marburg virus in blood, serum, or other bodily fluids.
2. Serological tests: These tests can detect antibodies to the Marburg virus in the blood, which may indicate a past or current infection.
3. Electron microscopy: This test can identify the Marburg virus particles in the sample.

It is essential to note that due to the high risk of infection and the need for specialized equipment and facilities, the diagnosis and management of Marburg HF should be performed in a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory by trained personnel.

In case of suspected Marburg HF, the patient should be immediately isolated and transferred to a specialized medical facility for proper diagnosis and treatment. If you suspect someone has been exposed to Marburg virus, seek medical attention immediately."

However, avoiding fruit bats, and sick non-human primates in central Africa, is one way to protect against infection. 
 
Measures for prevention of secondary, or person-to-person, transmission are similar to those used for other hemorrhagic fevers. If a patient is either suspected or confirmed to have Marburg hemorrhagic fever, barrier nursing techniques should be used to prevent direct physical contact with the patient. These precautions include wearing of protective gowns, gloves, and masks; placing the infected individual in strict isolation; and sterilization or proper disposal of needles, equipment, and patient excretions. 
 
In conjunction with the World Health Organization, CDC has developed practical, hospital-based guidelines, titled: Infection Control for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers In the African Health Care Setting. The manual can help health-care facilities recognize cases and prevent further hospital-based disease transmission using locally available materials and few financial resources. 
 
Marburg hemorrhagic fever is a very rare human disease. However, when it occurs, it has the potential to spread to other people, especially health care staff and family members who care for the patient. Therefore, increasing awareness in communities and among health-care providers of the clinical symptoms of patients with Marburg hemorrhagic fever is critical. Better awareness can lead to earlier and stronger precautions against the spread of Marburg virus in both family members and health-care providers. Improving the use of diagnostic tools is another priority. With modern means of transportation that give access even to remote areas, it is possible to obtain rapid testing of samples in disease control centers equipped with Biosafety Level 4 laboratories in order to confirm or rule out Marburg virus infection.","

The ecologic settings range from rain forests to deserts. Leishmaniasis usually is more common in rural than in urban areas, but it is found in the outskirts of some cities. Climate and other environmental changes have the potential to expand the geographic range of the sand fly vectors and the areas in the world where leishmaniasis is found.
    
Leishmaniasis is found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica.
    
     - In the Old World (the Eastern Hemisphere), leishmaniasis is found in some parts of Asia, the Middle East, Africa (particularly in the tropical region and North Africa, with some cases elsewhere), and southern Europe. It is not found in Australia or the Pacific islands.
     - In the New World (the Western Hemisphere), it is found in some parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America. It is not found in Chile or Uruguay. Occasional cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis have been acquired in Texas and Oklahoma.
    
    
The number of new cases per year is not known with certainty. For cutaneous leishmaniasis, estimates of the number of cases range from approximately 0.7 million (700,000) to 1.2 million (1,200,000). For visceral leishmaniasis, estimates of the number of cases range from approximately 0.2 million (200,000) to 0.4 million (400,000). The cases of leishmaniasis evaluated in the United States reflect travel and immigration patterns. For example, many of the cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in U.S. civilian travelers have been acquired in common tourist destinations in Latin America, such as in Costa Rica.
    
Overall, infection in people is caused by more than 20 species (types) of Leishmania parasites, which are spread by about 30 species of phlebotomine sand flies; particular species of the parasite are spread by particular sand flies. The sand fly vectors generally are the most active during twilight, evening, and night-time hours (from dusk to dawn).
    
In many geographic areas where leishmaniasis is found in people, infected people are not needed to maintain the transmission cycle of the parasite in nature; infected animals (such as rodents or dogs), along with sand flies, maintain the cycle. However, in some parts of the world, infected people are needed to maintain the cycle; this type of transmission (human—sand fly—human) is called anthroponotic. In areas with anthroponotic transmission, effective treatment of individual patients can help control the spread of the parasite.","
Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania. It can affect various groups of people, but it is most commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and southern Europe. People at risk include those living in or traveling to these areas, as well as those with weakened immune systems, such as individuals with HIV/AIDS or those who have undergone organ transplants. Additionally, poverty, malnutrition, and lack of access to clean water and sanitation can increase the risk of contracting Leishmaniasis."

Tissue specimens—such as from skin sores (for cutaneous leishmaniasis) or from bone marrow (for visceral leishmaniasis)—can be examined for the parasite under a microscope, in special cultures, and in other ways. Blood tests that detect antibody (an immune response) to the parasite can be helpful for cases of visceral leishmaniasis; tests to look for the parasite itself usually also are done.
    
More on: Resources for Health Professionals: Diagnosis","
Diagnosing parasites, such as those that cause Leishmaniasis, can be challenging due to the complex nature of these organisms and the various symptoms they present. In the case of Leishmaniasis, the parasite responsible is Leishmania spp.

In the acute phase of Leishmaniasis, the parasite can sometimes be directly observed in the affected tissue or blood, but this method is not common due to the time-consuming nature of the process.

In the chronic phase, the presence of the parasite can be inferred through the detection of antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection. This can be done through various laboratory tests such as serological tests, which measure the levels of antibodies in the blood.

It's important to note that the accuracy of these tests can vary, and false negatives are possible, especially in the early stages of infection. Therefore, a definitive diagnosis may require a combination of tests, including microscopic examination of tissue samples, culture, and serological tests.

In addition to these diagnostic methods, efforts are ongoing to develop new, more accurate tests for the detection of Leishmaniasis parasites.

If you suspect you have been infected with Leishmaniasis, it is recommended that you consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment."

Treatment decisions should be individualized. Health care providers may consult CDC staff about the relative merits of various approaches. Examples of factors to consider include the form of leishmaniasis, the Leishmania species that caused it, the potential severity of the case, and the patient's underlying health.
    
The skin sores of cutaneous leishmaniasis usually heal on their own, even without treatment. But this can take months or even years, and the sores can leave ugly scars. Another potential concern applies to some (not all) types of the parasite found in parts of Latin America: certain types might spread from the skin and cause sores in the mucous membranes of the nose (most common location), mouth, or throat (mucosal leishmaniasis). Mucosal leishmaniasis might not be noticed until years after the original sores healed. The best way to prevent mucosal leishmaniasis is to ensure adequate treatment of the cutaneous infection.
    
If not treated, severe (advanced) cases of visceral leishmaniasis typically are fatal.

The treatment for Leishmaniasis involves medication to eliminate the parasite, impair the adult worms' ability to reproduce, and kill adult worms. Either ivermectin, albendazole, or diethylcarbamazine is used for this purpose. However, much of the tissue damage may not be reversible. The medication is started at low doses to prevent reactions. In mild cases of lymphatic filariasis, the prognosis is good. For heavy parasitic infestations, the prognosis is poor.

While the parasite is found throughout the world, more than 60 million people in the United States may be infected with the Toxoplasma parasite. Of those who are infected, very few have symptoms because a healthy person’s immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. However, pregnant women and individuals who have compromised immune systems should be cautious; for them, a Toxoplasma infection could cause serious health problems.","
Parasites are organisms that live on or in another organism and take nourishment from that organism. Toxoplasma is a specific type of parasite that can infect humans, causing Toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma is a protozoan, a single-celled organism that exists as a parasite and can cause disease in humans. It was first identified as a cause of disease in humans in the 1940s. Toxoplasma is often passed in the feces of infected animals and can survive for long periods in soil and water.

If you'd like, you can also mention that Toxoplasma can cause symptoms such as fever, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches, and fatigue. In some cases, it can also affect the brain and eyes, leading to more severe symptoms. If you suspect you have Toxoplasmosis, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment."

In the United States it is estimated that 22.5% of the population 12 years and older have been infected with Toxoplasma. In various places throughout the world, it has been shown that up to 95% of some populations have been infected with Toxoplasma. Infection is often highest in areas of the world that have hot, humid climates and lower altitudes. 
    
Toxoplasmosis is not passed from person-to-person, except in instances of mother-to-child (congenital) transmission and blood transfusion or organ transplantation. People typically become infected by three principal routes of transmission. 
         
     
     
       
      
     
    
      
    Foodborne transmission 
    
The tissue form of the parasite (a microscopic cyst consisting of bradyzoites) can be transmitted to humans by food. People become infected by: 
     
     - Eating undercooked, contaminated meat (especially pork, lamb, and venison) 
     - Accidental ingestion of undercooked, contaminated meat after handling it and not washing hands thoroughly (Toxoplasma cannot be absorbed through intact skin) 
     - Eating food that was contaminated by knives, utensils, cutting boards, or other foods that had contact with raw, contaminated meat 
     
    
      
    Animal-to-human (zoonotic) transmission 
    
Cats play an important role in the spread of toxoplasmosis. They become infected by eating infected rodents, birds, or other small animals. The parasite is then passed in the cat's feces in an oocyst form, which is microscopic. 
    
Kittens and cats can shed millions of oocysts in their feces for as long as 3 weeks after infection. Mature cats are less likely to shed Toxoplasma if they have been previously infected. A Toxoplasma-infected cat that is shedding the parasite in its feces contaminates the litter box. If the cat is allowed outside, it can contaminate the soil or water in the environment as well. 
     
       
      
     
    
People can accidentally swallow the oocyst form of the parasite. People can be infected by: 
     
     - Accidental ingestion of oocysts after cleaning a cat's litter box when the cat has shed Toxoplasma in its feces 
     - Accidental ingestion of oocysts after touching or ingesting anything that has come into contact with a cat's feces that contain Toxoplasma 
     - Accidental ingestion of oocysts in contaminated soil (e.g., not washing hands after gardening or eating unwashed fruits or vegetables from a garden) 
     - Drinking water contaminated with the Toxoplasma parasite 
     
    
      
    Mother-to-child (congenital) transmission 
    
A woman who is newly infected with Toxoplasma during pregnancy can pass the infection to her unborn child (congenital infection). The woman may not have symptoms, but there can be severe consequences for the unborn child, such as diseases of the nervous system and eyes. 
    
      
    Rare instances of transmission 
    
Organ transplant recipients can become infected by receiving an organ from a Toxoplasma-positive donor. Rarely, people can also become infected by receiving infected blood via transfusion. Laboratory workers who handle infected blood can also acquire infection through accidental inoculation.","
Toxoplasma infection, also known as Toxoplasmosis, can affect a wide range of individuals. However, those with compromised immune systems, such as individuals with HIV/AIDS, organ transplant recipients, and people undergoing chemotherapy, are at a higher risk. Pregnant women should also be cautious as the infection can potentially harm the developing fetus. Additionally, people who handle raw or undercooked meat, especially lamb, pork, and venison, and those who come into contact with cat feces or soil contaminated with cat feces are at a higher risk due to the parasite's ability to survive in these environments."

A test that measures immunoglobulin G (IgG) is used to determine if a person has been infected. If it is necessary to try to estimate the time of infection, which is of particular importance for pregnant women, a test which measures immunoglobulin M (IgM) is also used along with other tests such as an avidity test.
    
Diagnosis can be made by direct observation of the parasite in stained tissue sections, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or other biopsy material. These techniques are used less frequently because of the difficulty of obtaining these specimens.
    
Parasites can also be isolated from blood or other body fluids (for example, CSF) but this process can be difficult and requires considerable time.
    
Molecular techniques that can detect the parasite's DNA in the amniotic fluid can be useful in cases of possible mother-to-child (congenital) transmission.
    
Ocular disease is diagnosed based on the appearance of the lesions in the eye, symptoms, course of disease, and often serologic testing.","
Toxoplasmosis can be diagnosed through several methods, including blood tests, tissue tests, and imaging tests. Blood tests are often used to detect antibodies produced by the immune system in response to the Toxoplasma gondii infection. If the individual has recently been infected, IgM antibodies will be present. In cases where the infection has been present for a longer period, IgG antibodies will be detected. Tissue tests, such as brain biopsies, can be performed to directly observe the presence of Toxoplasma cysts. Imaging tests, like CT scans or MRI, may also be used to visualize lesions caused by the parasite in the brain or other organs. In some cases, a doctor may also recommend a PCR test to detect the DNA of the parasite in the blood or other bodily fluids. If you suspect you have been infected with Toxoplasma, consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment."

Most healthy people recover from toxoplasmosis without treatment. Persons who are ill can be treated with a combination of drugs such as pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, plus folinic acid.
    
     
    Pregnant women, newborns, and infants
    
Pregnant women, newborns, and infants can be treated, although the parasite is not eliminated completely. The parasites can remain within tissue cells in a less active phase; their location makes it difficult for the medication to completely eliminate them.
    
     
    Persons with ocular disease
    
Persons with ocular toxoplasmosis are sometimes prescribed medicine to treat active disease by their ophthalmologist. Whether or not medication is recommended depends on the size of the eye lesion, the location, and the characteristics of the lesion (acute active, versus chronic not progressing).
    
     
    Persons with compromised immune systems
    
Persons with compromised immune systems need to be treated until they have improvement in their condition. For AIDS patients, continuation of medication for the rest of their lives may be necessary, or for as long as they are immunosuppressed.

Treatment for Toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma infection) primarily focuses on managing symptoms, as there are no specific antiparasitic drugs that can eradicate the parasite completely. Present medications can reduce the duration and severity of an acute infection, but they are only about 50% effective. In most cases, treatment involves the use of antibiotics such as pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, which are often combined with folinic acid to reduce side effects. In severe cases, corticosteroids may be used to manage inflammation. It is important to note that treatment should be administered by a healthcare professional, and the specific treatment plan will depend on factors such as the patient's overall health, the severity of the infection, and the presence of any complications. In addition, individuals with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, may require more aggressive treatment. If you suspect you have Toxoplasmosis, it is important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment."

If you have a weakened immune system, please see guidelines for Immunocompromised Persons.
   Reduce Risk from Food
   
To prevent risk of toxoplasmosis and other infections from food:
   
    - Freeze meat for several days at sub-zero (0° F) temperatures before cooking to greatly reduce chance of infection.
    - Peel or wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating. 
     
      
     
    - Wash cutting boards, dishes, counters, utensils, and hands with hot soapy water after contact with raw meat, poultry, seafood, or unwashed fruits or vegetables.
   
   
More on: Handwashing
   
The U.S. Government and the meat industry continue their efforts to reduce T. gondii in meat.
   Reduce Risk from the Environment
   
To prevent risk of toxoplasmosis from the environment:
   
    - Avoid drinking untreated drinking water.
    - Wear gloves when gardening and during any contact with soil or sand because it might be contaminated with cat feces that contain Toxoplasma. Wash hands with soap and warm water after gardening or contact with soil or sand.
    - Teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection.
    - Keep outdoor sandboxes covered. 
     
      
     
    - Feed cats only canned or dried commercial food or well-cooked table food, not raw or undercooked meats.
    - Change the litter box daily if you own a cat. The Toxoplasma parasite does not become infectious until 1 to 5 days after it is shed in a cat's feces. If you are pregnant or immunocompromised: 
     
      - Avoid changing cat litter if possible. If no one else can perform the task, wear disposable gloves and wash your hands with soap and warm water afterwards.
      - Keep cats indoors.
      - Do not adopt or handle stray cats, especially kittens. Do not get a new cat while you are pregnant.","
To prevent Toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma infection), the following precautions can be taken:

1. Avoid contact with cat feces: Toxoplasma gondii is present in the feces of infected cats. Therefore, it's important to wear gloves while gardening or cleaning the litter box of a cat.

2. Cook meat thoroughly: Toxoplasma gondii can be found in undercooked or raw meat, especially pork and lamb. To prevent infection, ensure that all meat is cooked to a safe internal temperature.

3. Wash fruits and vegetables: Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly to remove any potential contamination from soil or water sources.

4. Maintain good hygiene: Wash hands frequently, especially after handling raw meat, gardening, or changing a cat's litter box.

5. Avoid contact with contaminated water: Toxoplasma gondii can be found in contaminated water, so it's important to avoid swimming in lakes or streams with known contamination, and to avoid drinking untreated water from these sources.

6. Pregnant women should avoid contact with cat litter: Pregnant women should have someone else change their cat's litter box to minimize the risk of infection.

7. Keep indoor cats: Outdoor cats are more likely to come into contact with infected rodents, which can increase the risk of Toxoplasma infection. Keeping cats indoors can help prevent exposure.

8. Practice safe sexual behavior: Toxoplasma gondii can be transmitted sexually, so it's important to practice safe sexual behavior, especially if either partner has a compromised immune system.

The larvae and adult worms live in the small intestine can cause intestinal disease. The two main species of hookworm infecting humans are Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus.,"
Parasites - Hookworms are small, round, blood-sucking worms that infest approximately 700 million people worldwide. They are a type of flatworm (Trematodes) that have complex life cycles involving hosts other than humans. Hookworms are contracted by eating uncooked fish, plants, or animals from hookworm-infected waters. In humans, they mature into adult worms and can cause various symptoms, such as anemia, cough, pneumonia, and an itchy rash, particularly when the larvae migrate through the lungs. The condition can be diagnosed by microscopic inspection of feces or visual inspection of the skin, and treatment is available for those experiencing intestinal symptoms."

Infection is caused by the nematode parasites Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale. Hookworm infections often occur in areas where human feces are used as fertilizer or where defecation onto soil happens.
    Geographic Distribution
    
The geographic distributions of the hookworm species that are intestinal parasites in human, Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, are worldwide in areas with warm, moist climates and are widely overlapping. Necator americanus was widespread in the Southeastern United States until the early 20th century.","
Parasites - Hookworm primarily pose a risk to children and individuals who crawl beneath raised buildings or lie down on wet sand contaminated with hookworm larvae. This is due to their play habits and attraction to pets, as well as the high prevalence of hookworms in pets in the United States. People who have pets should ensure they are dewormed to prevent the spread of hookworms."

To diagnose Ascariasis, a parasitic infection caused by the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides, several methods can be used. However, it's important to note that the symptoms of Ascariasis can be mild and often go unnoticed, making the diagnosis challenging.

1. Stool Examination: The most common method for diagnosing Ascariasis is by examining the stool for the presence of Ascaris eggs. These eggs are large and easily visible under a microscope.

2. Imaging Tests: If the infection is severe, imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, or ultrasounds may be used to visualize the adult worms in the intestines or any complications they may have caused, such as intestinal blockage or lung infiltration.

3. Eosinophilia: A blood test to check for an increased number of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) may suggest an Ascariasis infection, although this is not definitive.

4. Serology Tests: These tests detect antibodies produced by the immune system in response to the infection. However, they may not be reliable in cases of light infections or when the infection has been treated recently."

Recommendations and Guidelines General Information about VISA/VRSA For more images of this bacterium, search the Public Health Image Library Vancomycin [van−kō−mī−sin]-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus [staff−u−lu−kaw−kus  aw−ree−us] (also called VISA) and Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also called VRSA) are specific types of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. However, as of October 2010, all VISA and VRSA isolates have been susceptible to other Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Persons who develop this type of staph infection may have underlying health conditions (such as diabetes and kidney disease), tubes going into their bodies (such as catheters), previous infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and recent exposure to vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents. What is Staphylococcus aureus? Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of about 30% of individuals. Most of the time, staph does not cause any harm. These infections can look like pimples, boils, or other skin conditions and most are able to be treated. Sometimes staph bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause serious infections which can be fatal, including: Bacteremia or sepsis when bacteria spread to the bloodstream usually as a result of using catheters or having surgery. Pneumonia which predominantly affects people with underlying lung disease including those on mechanical ventilators. Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) which can lead to heart failure. Osteomyelitis (bone infection) which can be caused by staph bacteria traveling in the bloodstream or put there by direct contact such as following trauma (puncture wound of foot or intravenous (IV) drug abuse). Top of page How do VISA and VRSA get their names? Staph bacteria are classified as VISA or VRSA based on laboratory tests. Laboratories perform tests to determine if staph bacteria are resistant to antimicrobial agents that might be used for treatment of infections. For vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents, laboratories determine how much of the agent it requires to inhibit the growth of the organism in a test tube. The result of the test is usually expressed as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or the minimum amount of antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial growth in the test tube. Therefore, staph bacteria are classified as VISA if the MIC for vancomycin is 4-8µg/ml, and classified as VRSA if the vancomycin MIC is ≥16µg/ml. Top of page What should a patient do if they suspect they have a staph, MRSA, VISA, or VRSA infection? See a healthcare provider. Top of page Are VISA and VRSA infections treatable? Yes. As of October 2010, all VISA and VRSA isolates have been susceptible to several Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Top of page How can the spread of VISA and VRSA be prevented? Use of appropriate infection control practices (such as wearing gloves before and after contact with infectious body substances and adherence to hand hygiene) by healthcare personnel can reduce the spread of VISA and VRSA. Top of page What should a person do if a family member or close friend has VISA or VRSA? VISA and VRSA are types of antibiotic-resistant staph bacteria. Therefore, as with all staph bacteria, spread occurs among people having close physical contact with infected patients or contaminated material, such as bandages. Persons having close physical contact with infected patients while they are outside of the healthcare setting should: (1) keep their hands clean by washing thoroughly with soap and water, and (2) avoid contact with other people's wounds or material contaminated from wounds. If they go to the hospital to visit a friend or family member who is infected with VISA or VRSA , they must follow the hospital's recommended precautions. Top of page What is CDC doing to address VISA and VRSA? In addition to providing guidance for clinicians and infection control personnel, CDC is also working with state and local health agencies, healthcare facilities, and clinical microbiology laboratories to ensure that laboratories are using proper methods to detect VISA and VRSA. Top of page Recommendations and Guidelines CDC issued a Clinical Reminder, in 2010, which serves as a reminder about the important role of clinical laboratories in the diagnosis of VRSA cases to ensure prompt recognition, isolation, and management by infection control personnel.

What is Staphylococcus aureus? Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of about 30% of individuals. Most of the time, staph does not cause any harm. These infections can look like pimples, boils, or other skin conditions and most are able to be treated. Sometimes staph bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause serious infections which can be fatal, including: Bacteremia or sepsis when bacteria spread to the bloodstream usually as a result of using catheters or having surgery. Pneumonia which predominantly affects people with underlying lung disease including those on mechanical ventilators. Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) which can lead to heart failure. Osteomyelitis (bone infection) which can be caused by staph bacteria traveling in the bloodstream or put there by direct contact such as following trauma (puncture wound of foot or intravenous (IV) drug abuse). Top of page How do VISA and VRSA get their names? Staph bacteria are classified as VISA or VRSA based on laboratory tests. Laboratories perform tests to determine if staph bacteria are resistant to antimicrobial agents that might be used for treatment of infections. For vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents, laboratories determine how much of the agent it requires to inhibit the growth of the organism in a test tube. The result of the test is usually expressed as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or the minimum amount of antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial growth in the test tube. Therefore, staph bacteria are classified as VISA if the MIC for vancomycin is 4-8µg/ml, and classified as VRSA if the vancomycin MIC is ≥16µg/ml.

The provided context does not contain information about the prevention of VISA (variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) or VRSA (Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). However, based on the information provided, it is clear that prevention strategies for diseases, in general, can include maintaining good hygiene, nutrition, and avoiding crowded areas or people with active infections.

For VRSA, prevention measures typically focus on infection control practices in healthcare settings, such as hand hygiene, using appropriate personal protective equipment, and implementing antibiotic stewardship programs to reduce the use of vancomycin and other last-resort antibiotics.

For VISA, as it is a prion disease like vCJD, prevention strategies may be similar to those for vCJD, such as good hygiene, nutrition, and avoiding crowds or people with active infections. However, since the infectious potential of contaminated meat is unknown for VISA, it is important to follow guidelines for safe food handling and cooking practices.

It is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or a public health authority for the most accurate and up-to-date information on the prevention of specific diseases."

Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a viral disease that can cause fever, severe bleeding, and organ failure. To diagnose CCHF, a combination of clinical, laboratory, and serological tests are used.

1. Clinical symptoms: The presence of fever, headache, and signs of bleeding (such as petechiae or ecchymoses) are common in CCHF patients. However, these symptoms are not specific to CCHF, and other diseases may present similarly.

2. Laboratory tests: Complete blood count (CBC) may reveal a low platelet count, low white blood cell count, and anemia. Coagulation tests, such as prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), can help assess the clotting function of the blood. Liver function tests may also be abnormal due to the virus's impact on the liver.

3. Serological tests: These tests detect the presence of antibodies against the CCHF virus in the blood. The most commonly used test is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A positive result indicates exposure to the virus, but it may take several days after the onset of symptoms for the antibodies to be detectable.

4. Molecular tests: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be used to directly detect the CCHF virus in blood, serum, or other bodily fluids. This test is more sensitive and specific than serological tests, but it requires specialized equipment and expertise.

5. If CCHF is suspected based on clinical and laboratory findings, it is important to isolate the patient to prevent the spread of the virus. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended for proper management and treatment."

Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a viral disease, and there is currently no specific antiviral treatment available. The main goal of treatment is supportive care to manage symptoms and prevent complications. This may include:

1. Rehydration: To prevent dehydration due to vomiting and diarrhea.
2. Electrolyte replacement: To balance the levels of essential minerals in the body, such as sodium, potassium, and chloride.
3. Blood transfusions: In severe cases, blood transfusions may be necessary to replace lost blood and prevent anemia.
4. Plasma transfusions: In some cases, plasma transfusions may be given to provide antibodies that can help fight the virus.
5. Treatment of complications: This may include managing bleeding with medications like heparin (although its use in treating CCHF is controversial), and addressing other symptoms like fever and organ dysfunction as they arise."

An inactivated, mouse-brain derived vaccine against CCHF has been developed and is used on a small scale in Eastern Europe. However, there is no safe and effective vaccine currently available for human use. Further research is needed to develop these potential vaccines as well as determine the efficacy of different treatment options including ribavirin and other antiviral drugs.","
The disease itself cannot be prevented, but precautions can be taken to reduce the risk of infection. For example, avoiding contact with infected animals and their tissues, wearing protective clothing, and using insect repellents can help. Additionally, proper cooking of meat can kill the virus if it is present. In areas where CCHF is endemic, vaccination may be available for high-risk individuals, such as healthcare workers and military personnel.

Reducing exposure to mosquitoes is the best defense against infection with EEEV and other mosquito-borne viruses. There are several approaches you and your family can use to prevent and control mosquito-borne diseases. 
   
   -  Use repellent: When outdoors, use insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin and/or clothing. The repellent/insecticide permethrin can be used on clothing to protect through several washes. Always follow the directions on the package.  
   -  Wear protective clothing: Wear long sleeves and pants when weather permits.  
   -  Install and repair screens: Have secure, intact screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out.  
   -  Keep mosquitoes from laying eggs near you: Mosquitoes can lay eggs even in small amounts of standing water. Get rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower pots, buckets, barrels, and tires. Change the water in pet dishes and replace the water in bird baths weekly. Drill holes in tire swings so water drains out. Empty children's wading pools and store on their side after use.  
","
To prevent Eastern Equine Encephalitis, it is recommended to minimize contact with others who may have any of the viral illnesses listed above. Additionally, since the virus is also carried by mosquitoes, it's crucial to take precautions against mosquito bites, especially during mid- to late summer when they are most active, in rural areas where these viruses are known to exist. The eastern United States is where Eastern equine encephalitis occurs. To protect against mosquito bites, wear long sleeves and pants, use insect repellent, and avoid being outdoors during dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active. If you live in an area where Eastern equine encephalitis is common, consider getting a mosquito-borne illness vaccine, but consult with a healthcare professional before doing so. If you suspect you have been exposed to Eastern equine encephalitis, seek medical attention immediately."

 - diarrhea 
 
                
Bleeding was not a prominent feature during the illness. 
                
In the fatal cases (4/5 patients), a transient improvement was followed by: 
 
 - rapid deterioration with respiratory distress 
 - neurological signs and circulatory collapse 
 
                
Death occurred 10 to 13 days after onset. 
                
Low blood platelets, low white blood cell count (at the onset, rising later on) and elevated liver function values were present in all patients. 
                
Since Arenaviruses may enter the fetus through infection of the mother, and anectodal evidence suggests that infected pregnant women may suffer miscarriages, it is reasonable to assume that both infection of the fetus and miscarriage may be associated with Lujo infection in the mother.","

   Field workers 
   
Field workers are at greatest risk because of increased human contact with the reservoir rodent population. Sexual partners of field workers may be at greater risk as well. In addition to nosocomial infection in healthcare workers already described, laboratory infections have been frequently described with Arenaviruses and Lujo virus can certainly be transmitted to laboratory workers during manipulation of the virus, especially during experimental infections of rodents.","
Lujo Hemorrhagic Fever (LUHF) is a rare viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lujo virus. It is primarily found in West Africa, particularly in Nigeria. People at risk for LUHF are those who have close contact with infected animals, such as rodents and bats, or their bodily fluids. Healthcare workers who treat patients with LUHF are also at risk, as they may come into contact with infected blood or other bodily fluids. It's important to note that the virus can also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces."

Virus was also isolated from liver tissue obtained post-mortem. A subsequent complete genomic analysis of Lujo virus facilitated the development of specific molecular detection (RT-PCR) assays. 
   
Serologic diagnosis of Lujo hemorrhagic fever can be made by indirect immunofluorescent assay and ELISA. However, individuals from endemic areas displaying fever, rash, pharyngitis, accompanied by laboratory findings of low platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes, should be suspected of having a hemorrhagic fever virus infection. Clinical specimens should be tested using specific assays.","
Diagnosing Lujo Hemorrhagic Fever (LUHF) can be challenging due to its non-specific symptoms, which are similar to other febrile illnesses. However, a thorough evaluation is crucial for an accurate diagnosis.

The diagnostic process often involves:
1. Obtaining a detailed patient history, including travel history, contact with animals, and exposure to contaminated environments.
2. Performing laboratory tests such as blood tests, serological assays, and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) tests to detect the presence of LUHF virus.
3. In some cases, a biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

It is important to note that LUHF is a rare and potentially fatal disease, so prompt and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. If a patient exhibits symptoms of LUHF, they should seek immediate medical attention.

    - transfusions (when necessary) 
    
   
Treatment of arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers with convalescent plasma therapy reduces mortality significantly and anectodal evidence from the only surviving Lujo patient shows that the antiviral drug ribavirin may hold promise in the treatment of LUHF. Ribavirin has been considered for preventing development of disease in people exposed to other arenaviruses. 
   Recovery 
   
The precise mortality of LUHF is unknown, but 4 of 5 described cases were fatal. 
   
Patients who have suffered from other arenaviruses may excrete virus in urine or semen for weeks after recovery. For this reason, these fluids should be monitored for infectivity, since convalescent patients have the potential to infect others (particularly sexual partners) via these fluids.","
The context does not provide information about Lujo Hemorrhagic Fever (LUHF) and its treatments. However, it does mention that treatment for other hemorrhagic fevers, such as Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS), involves correction of clotting factors, plasma exchange, and kidney dialysis. Blood transfusions may also be required. Antibiotics are often used in the treatment of E. coli infections, but it's unclear if this applies to LUHF as well.

It is always better to prevent a disease than to treat it after it occurs. Diseases that used to be common in this country and around the world, including polio, measles, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), rubella (German measles), mumps, tetanus, rotavirus and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) can now be prevented by vaccination. Thanks to a vaccine, one of the most terrible diseases in history – smallpox – no longer exists outside the laboratory. Over the years vaccines have prevented countless cases of disease and saved millions of lives. Immunity Protects us From Disease Immunity is the body’s way of preventing disease.  Children are born with an immune system composed of cells, glands, organs, and fluids located throughout the body. The immune system recognizes germs that enter the body as ""foreign invaders” (called antigens) and produces proteins called antibodies to fight them. The first time a child is infected with a specific antigen (say measles virus), the immune system produces antibodies designed to fight it. This takes time . . . usually the immune system can’t work fast enough to prevent the antigen from causing disease, so the child still gets sick.  However, the immune system “remembers” that antigen. If it ever enters the body again, even after many years, the immune system can produce antibodies fast enough to keep it from causing disease a second time. This protection is called immunity. It would be nice if there were a way to give children immunity to a disease without their having to get sick first. In fact there is: Vaccines contain the same antigens (or parts of antigens) that cause diseases. For example, measles vaccine contains measles virus. But the antigens in vaccines are either killed, or weakened to the point that they don’t cause disease. However, they are strong enough to make the immune system produce antibodies that lead to immunity. In other words, a vaccine is a safer substitute for a child’s first exposure to a disease. The child gets protection without having to get sick. Through vaccination, children can develop immunity without suffering from the actual diseases that vaccines prevent. Top of Page More Facts Newborn babies are immune to many diseases because they have antibodies they got from their mothers. However, this immunity goes away during the first year of life. If an unvaccinated child is exposed to a disease germ, the child's body may not be strong enough to fight the disease. Before vaccines, many children died from diseases that vaccines now prevent, such as whooping cough, measles, and polio. Those same germs exist today, but because babies are protected by vaccines, we don’t see these diseases nearly as often. Immunizing individual children also helps to protect the health of our community, especially those people who cannot be immunized (children who are too young to be vaccinated, or those who can’t receive certain vaccines for medical reasons), and the small proportion of people who don’t respond to a particular vaccine. Vaccine-preventable diseases have a costly impact, resulting in doctor's visits, hospitalizations, and premature deaths. Sick children can also cause parents to lose time from work.

Vaccines prevent diseases by introducing a small amount of a weakened or killed form of a specific virus or bacteria into the body. This stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies, which are proteins that can recognize and attack the virus or bacteria. If the person is later exposed to the actual disease-causing virus or bacteria, their immune system will be able to quickly recognize it and fight it off before the person becomes sick. However, it's important to note that not all vaccines prevent diseases, as some, like cancer vaccines, are designed to treat people who already have the disease by boosting the immune system and training immune cells to specifically destroy cancer cells."

To prevent the recurrent infections commonly associated with the disease, patients and their families can take precautions such as maintaining good hygiene and nutrition, avoiding crowds or people who have active infections. Additionally, it's important to avoid known or suspected allergens or irritating substances, and if avoidance is difficult, barrier creams and protective clothing can be used.

For other conditions, common sense and following safety precautions are the best ways to prevent foreign objects from entering the body. For example, parents and grandparents should toddler-proof their homes, storing batteries in a locked cabinet and properly disposing of used batteries, so they are not in a location where curious preschoolers can fish them out of a wastebasket. To minimize the chance of youngsters inhaling food, parents should not let small objects such as toys, coins, or buttons be put in their mouths.

In the United States, the term “ehrlichiosis” may be broadly applied to several different infections. Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia ewingii are transmitted by the lonestar tick in the southeastern and southcentral United States. In addition, a third Ehrlichia species provisionally called Ehrlichia muris-like (EML) has been identified in a small number of patients residing in or traveling to Minnesota and Wisconsin; a tick vector for the EML organism has not yet been established. The symptoms caused by infection with these Ehrlichia species usually develop 1-2 weeks after being bitten by an infected tick.  The tick bite is usually painless, and about half of the people who develop ehrlichiosis may not even remember being bitten by a tick.  
                
 The following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease, however, it is important to note that the combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person. 
 
 - Fever 
 - Headache 
 - Chills 
 - Malaise 
 - Muscle pain 
 - Nausea / Vomiting / Diarrhea 
 - Confusion 
 - Conjunctival injection (red eyes) 
 - Rash (in up to 60% of children, less than 30% of adults) 
 
                
Ehrlichiosis is a serious illness that can be fatal if not treated correctly, even in previously healthy people.  Severe clinical presentations may include difficulty breathing, or bleeding disorders. The estimated case fatality rate (i.e. the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection) is 1.8%. Patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication, while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization or intensive care.  
                
 
Rash 
                
Skin rash is not considered a common feature of ehrlichiosis, and should not be used to rule in or rule out an infection. Ehrlichia chaffeensis infection can cause a rash in up to 60% of children, but is reported in fewer than 30% of adults. Rash is not commonly reported in patients infected with Ehrlichia ewingii or the Ehrlichia muris-like organism.  The rash associated with Ehrlichia chaffeensis infection may range from maculopapular to petechial in nature, and is usually not pruritic (itchy). The rash usually spares the face, but in some cases may spread to the palms and soles.  A type of rash called erythroderma may develop in some patients.  Erythroderma is a type of rash that resembles a sunburn and consists of widespread reddening of the skin that may peel after several days.  Some patients may develop a rash that resembles the rash of Rocky Mountain spotted fever making these two diseases difficult to differentiate on the basis of clinical signs alone. 
                
 
Immune-compromised Individuals 
                
The severity of ehrlichiosis may depend in part on the immune status of the patient. Persons with compromised immunity caused by immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., corticosteroids , cancer chemotherapy, or longterm immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplant), HIV infection, or splenectomy appear to develop more severe disease, and may also have higher case-fatality rates (i.e. the proportion of patients that die from infection.)   
                
 
Blood Transfusion and Organ Transplant Risks Associated with Ehrlichia species 
                
Because Ehrlichia organisms infect the white blood cells and circulate in the blood stream, these pathogens may pose a risk to be transmitted through blood transfusions. Ehrlichia chaffeensis has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood. Several instances of suspected E. chaffeensis transmission through solid organ transplant have been investigated, although to date no cases have been confirmed that can be attributed to this route of transmission. Patients who develop ehrlichiosis within a month of receiving a blood transfusion or solid organ transplant should be reported to state health officials for prompt investigation. Use of leukoreduced blood products may theoretically decrease the risk of transfusion-associated transmission of these pathogens. However, the filtration process does not remove all leukocytes or bacteria not associated with leukocytes from leukoreduced blood; therefore, this process may not eliminate the risk completely.

Diagnosis 
                
  
                
The diagnosis of ehrlichiosis must be made based on clinical signs and symptoms, and can later be confirmed using specialized confirmatory laboratory tests.  Treatment should never be delayed pending the receipt of laboratory test results, or be withheld on the basis of an initial negative laboratory result.  
Physician Diagnosis 
                
There are several aspects of ehrlichiosis that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat.  The symptoms vary from patient to patient and can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases.  Treatment is more likely to be effective if started early in the course of disease. Diagnostic tests based on the detection of antibodies will frequently be negative in the first 7-10 days of illness. 
                
For this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. Healthcare providers may find important information in the patient’s history and physical examination that may aid clinical suspicion. Information such as recent tick bites, exposure to areas where ticks are likely to be found, or history of recent travel to areas where ehrlichiosis is endemic can be helpful in making the diagnosis.  The healthcare provider should also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. Clues such as a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low white blood cell count (leukopenia), or elevated liver enzyme levels are helpful predictors of ehrlichiosis, but may not be present in all patients depending on the course of the disease.   After a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of ehrlichiosis. 
                
 
Laboratory Detection 
                
During the acute phase of illness, a sample of whole blood can be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to determine if a patient has ehrlichiosis. This method is most sensitive in the first week of illness, and quickly decreases in sensitivity following the administration of appropriate antibiotics. Although a positive PCR result is helpful, a negative result does not completely rule out the diagnosis. 
                
During the first week of illness a microscopic examination of blood smears (known as a peripheral blood smear) may reveal morulae (microcolonies of ehrlichiae) in the cytoplasm of white blood cells in up to 20% of patients. 
 
   
  
 
                
The type of blood cell in which morulae are observed may provide insight into the infecting species: E. chaffeensis most commonly infects monocytes, whereas E. ewingii more commonly infect granulocytes. However, the observance of morulae in a particular cell type cannot conclusively identify the infecting species. Culture isolation of Ehrlichia is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect Ehrlichia. 
                
When a person develops ehrlichiosis, their immune system produces antibodies to the Ehrlichia, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset.  It is important to note that antibodies are not detectable in the first week of illness in 85% of patients, and a negative test during this time does not rule out ehrlichiosis as a cause of illness.  
                
The gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of ehrlichiosis is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using E. chaffeensis antigen, performed on paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titers.  The first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. In most cases of ehrlichiosis, the first IgG IFA titer is typically low, or “negative,” and the second typically shows a significant (four-fold) increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or longer.  Also, IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive.  For these reasons, physicians requesting IgM serologic titers should also request a concurrent IgG titer. 
                
Serologic tests based on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) technology are available from some commercial laboratories. However, EIA tests are qualitative rather than quantitative, meaning they only provide a positive/negative result, and are less useful to measure changes in antibody titers between paired specimens. Furthermore, some EIA assays rely on the evaluation of IgM antibody alone, which may have a higher frequency of false positive results.  
                
Antibodies to E. chaffeensis may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms.  Up to 12% of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to Ehrlichia species or similar organisms. Therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret, while paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provides the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of ehrlichiosis.

Treatment 
                
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever ehrlichiosis is suspected.  
                
Use of antibiotics other than doxycycline and other tetracyclines is associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome for some rickettsial infections. Doxycycline is most effective at preventing severe complications from developing if it is started early in the course of disease. Therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return. 
                
If the patient is treated within the first 5 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours.  In fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient’s condition might not be due to ehrlichiosis. Severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves. Resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course have not been documented.  
                
Recommended Dosage 
                
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages: 
 
 - Adults: 100 mg every 12 hours 
 - Children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day 
 
                
Patients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. Standard duration of treatment is 7 to 14 days.  Some patients may continue to experience headache, weakness and malaise for weeks after adequate treatment. 
                
 
Treating children 
                
The use of doxycycline to treat suspected ehrlichiosis in children is standard practice recommended by both CDC and the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases. Unlike older generations of tetracyclines, the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat ehrlichiosis has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, even when five courses are given before the age of eight.  Healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the first-line treatment for suspected ehrlichiosis in patients of all ages.  
                
 
Other Treatments 
                
In cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of ehrlichiosis appears mild, physicians may need to consider alternate antibiotics. Although recommended as a second-line therapeutic alternative to treat Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), chloramphenicol is not recommended for the treatment of either ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis, as studies have shown a lack of efficacy. Rifampin appears effective against Ehrlichia in laboratory settings. However, rifampin is not effective in treating RMSF, a disease that may be confused with ehrlichiosis. Healthcare providers should be cautious when exploring treatments other than doxycycline, which is highly effective in treating both. Other antibiotics, including broad spectrum antibiotics are not considered highly effective against ehrlichiosis, and the use of sulfa drugs during acute illness may worsen the severity of infection.  
                
 
Prophylaxis (Preventive Treatment) 
                
Antibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent ehrlichiosis. There is no evidence this practice is effective, and this may simply delay onset of disease. Instead, persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever, rash, or other symptoms of concern develop.

Other Considerations 
                
The clinical presentation for ehrlichiosis can resemble other tickborne diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and anaplasmosis. Similar to ehrlichiosis, these infections respond well to treatment with doxycycline. Healthcare providers should order diagnostic tests for additional agents if the clinical history and geographic association warrant. For more in-depth about other similar tickborne diseases, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm","
Ehrlichiosis is a bacterial infection that is spread by ticks. Symptoms of Ehrlichiosis include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and tiredness. Additionally, a rash may occur. However, it's important to note that the symptoms are not unique, and the disease may be misdiagnosed. A recent history of a tick bite can help in the diagnosis. If you suspect you have been bitten by a tick and are experiencing these symptoms, it is recommended to consult a doctor, preferably a hematologist or an infectious disease specialist."

Ehrlichiosis is a bacterial infection that is transmitted by ticks. The symptoms of ehrlichiosis include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and tiredness. The disease is caused by the Ehrlichia bacteria, which are carried by ticks. To prevent ehrlichiosis, it is recommended to minimize exposure to ticks by staying on the trail when walking through the woods, avoiding tall grasses, wearing long sleeves and tucking pant legs into socks, and wearing insect repellent.

2. Elderly patients: Older adults, especially those in nursing homes or long-term care facilities, are at a higher risk due to their age and potential underlying health conditions.

3. Patients in intensive care units (ICUs): Critically ill patients, especially those on ventilators or with catheters, are at a higher risk due to the increased exposure to Acinetobacter in these settings.

4. Patients with medical devices: Those with catheters, drains, or other medical devices have a higher risk of Acinetobacter infections due to the potential for the bacteria to enter through these devices.

5. Healthcare workers: In some cases, healthcare workers may contract Acinetobacter infections if they do not follow proper infection control practices, such as hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment.

The context does not provide information about Acinetobacter in healthcare settings. However, it does mention that the choice of treatment for encephalitis, which is a different condition, depends on the cause. For bacterial encephalitis, antibiotics are used, but there is no mention of Acinetobacter as a cause of encephalitis. To answer the question accurately, more specific information about Acinetobacter in healthcare settings would be needed.

If you'd like to provide additional information about Acinetobacter in general, here it is:

Acinetobacter is a type of bacteria that can cause infections in various parts of the body, including the skin, lungs, and bloodstream. In healthcare settings, Acinetobacter infections can be particularly difficult to treat due to the bacteria's ability to develop resistance to multiple antibiotics.

Treatment typically involves administering antibiotics that are effective against Acinetobacter. The specific antibiotics used may depend on the type of infection and the patient's overall health. Common antibiotics used to treat Acinetobacter infections include carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and tigecycline.

Prevention of Acinetobacter infections in healthcare settings primarily involves strict infection control measures, such as hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, and environmental cleaning."

There are two kinds of tests that are used to determine if a person has been infected with TB bacteria: the tuberculin skin test and TB blood tests. 
  
A positive TB skin test or TB blood test only tells that a person has been infected with TB bacteria. It does not tell whether the person has latent TB infection (LTBI) or has progressed to TB disease. Other tests, such as a chest x-ray and a sample of sputum, are needed to see whether the person has TB disease. 
  
Tuberculin skin test: The TB skin test (also called the Mantoux tuberculin skin test) is performed by injecting a small amount of fluid (called tuberculin) into the skin in the lower part of the arm. A person given the tuberculin skin test must return within 48 to 72 hours to have a trained health care worker look for a reaction on the arm. The health care worker will look for a raised, hard area or swelling, and if present, measure its size using a ruler. Redness by itself is not considered part of the reaction. 
  
The skin test result depends on the size of the raised, hard area or swelling. It also depends on the person’s risk of being infected with TB bacteria and the progression to TB disease if infected. 
   
   - Positive skin test: This 
     means the person’s body was infected with TB bacteria. Additional tests are needed to determine if the person has latent TB infection or TB disease. A health care worker will then provide treatment as needed. 
   - Negative skin test: This means the person’s body did not react to the test, and that latent TB infection or TB disease is not likely. 
   
  
 
     TB blood tests: 
    TB blood tests (also called interferon-gamma release assays or IGRAs) measure how the immune system reacts to the bacteria that cause TB. An IGRA measures how strong a person’s immune system reacts to TB bacteria by testing the person’s blood in a laboratory. 
  
Two IGRAs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are available in the United States: 
   
   - QuantiFERON®–TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT) 
   - T-SPOT®.TB test (T-Spot) 
   
   
   - Positive IGRA: This means that the person has been infected with TB bacteria. Additional tests are needed to determine if the person has latent TB infection or TB disease. A health care worker will then provide treatment as needed. 
   - Negative IGRA: This means that the person’s blood did not react to the test and that latent TB infection or TB disease is not likely. 
   
  
IGRAs are the preferred method of TB infection testing for the following: 
    
   - People who have a difficult time returning for a second appointment to look for a reaction to the TST. 
   
  
There is no problem with repeated IGRAs. 
    
   
   
     Testing for TB in BCG-Vaccinated Persons 
  
Many people born outside of the United States have been BCG-vaccinated. 
  
People who have had a previous BCG vaccine may receive a TB skin test. In some people, BCG may cause a positive skin test when they are not infected with TB bacteria. If a TB skin test is positive, additional tests are needed. 
  
IGRAs, unlike the TB skin tests, are not affected by prior BCG vaccination and are not expected to give a false-positive result in people who have received BCG. 
   
     Choosing a TB Test 
  
The person’s health care provider should choose which TB test to use. Factors in selecting which test to use include the reason for testing, test availability, and cost. Generally, it is not recommended to test a person with both a TST and an IGRA. 
   
     Diagnosis of Latent TB Infection or TB Disease 
  
If a person is found to be infected with TB bacteria, other tests are needed to see if the person has TB disease. 
  
TB disease can be diagnosed by medical history, physical examination, chest x-ray, and other laboratory tests. TB disease is treated by taking several drugs as recommended by a health care provider. 
  
If a person does not have TB disease, but has TB bacteria in the body, then latent TB infection is diagnosed. The decision about treatment for latent TB infection will be based on a person’s chances of developing TB disease. 
   
     Diagnosis of TB Disease 
  
People suspected of having TB disease should be referred for a medical evaluation, which will include 
   
   - Medical history, 
   - Physical examination, 
   - Test for TB infection (TB skin test or TB blood test), 
   - Chest radiograph (X-ray), and 
   - Appropriate laboratory tests

To diagnose Tuberculosis (TB), a doctor may perform a tuberculosis skin test (also known as a Mantoux test) and a chest X-ray. The tuberculosis skin test involves injecting a small amount of tuberculosis protein under the skin on the forearm. After 48-72 hours, the site is examined for a reaction. A normal result indicates no or very little skin reaction, while a positive result suggests exposure to TB. A chest X-ray can help identify any abnormalities in the lungs, which are often associated with TB. If the test results are inconclusive, further testing may be necessary. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and diagnosis."

Tuberculosis (TB) transmission has been documented in health care settings where health care workers and patients come in contact with people who have TB disease.
  
People who work or receive care in health care settings are at higher risk for becoming infected with TB; therefore, it is necessary to have a TB infection control plan as part of a general infection control program designed to ensure the following:
  
   - prompt detection of infectious patients,
   - airborne precautions, and
   - treatment of people who have suspected or confirmed TB disease.
  
  
In order to be effective, the primary emphasis of a TB infection control program should be on achieving these three goals.
  
In all health care settings, particularly those in which people are at high risk for exposure to TB, policies and procedures for TB control should be developed, reviewed periodically, and evaluated for effectiveness to determine the actions necessary to minimize the risk for transmission of TB.
  
The TB infection control program should be based on a three-level hierarchy of control measures and include:
  
   - Administrative measures
   - Environmental controls
   - Use of respiratory protective equipment
  
  
The first and most important level of the hierarchy, administrative measures, impacts the largest number of people. It is intended primarily to reduce the risk of uninfected people who are exposed to people who have TB disease.
  
The second level of the hierarchy is the use of environmental controls to reduce the amount of TB in the air. The first two control levels of the hierarchy also minimize the number of areas in the health care setting where exposure to TB may occur.
  
The third level of the hierarchy is the use of respiratory protective equipment in situations that pose a high risk of exposure to TB. Use of respiratory protection equipment can further reduce the risk for exposure of health care workers.

     TB Prevention
  
Preventing Exposure to TB Disease While Traveling Abroad
Travelers should avoid close contact or prolonged time with known TB patients in crowded, enclosed environments (for example, clinics, hospitals, prisons, or homeless shelters).
  
Travelers who will be working in clinics, hospitals, or other health care settings where TB patients are likely to be encountered should consult infection control or occupational health experts. They should ask about administrative and environmental procedures for preventing exposure to TB. Once those procedures are implemented, additional measures could include using personal respiratory protective devices.
  
Travelers who anticipate possible prolonged exposure to people with TB (for example, those who expect to come in contact routinely with clinic, hospital, prison, or homeless shelter populations) should have a tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) test before leaving the United States. If the test reaction is negative, they should have a repeat test 8 to 10 weeks after returning to the United States. Additionally, annual testing may be recommended for those who anticipate repeated or prolonged exposure or an extended stay over a period of years. Because people with HIV infection are more likely to have an impaired response to both the TST and IGRA, travelers who are HIV positive should tell their physicians about their HIV infection status.

     Preventing Latent TB Infection from Progressing to TB Disease
  
Many people who have latent TB infection never develop TB disease. But some people who have latent TB infection are more likely to develop TB disease than others. Those at high risk for developing TB disease include:
  
   - People with HIV infection
   - People who became infected with TB bacteria in the last 2 years
   - Babies and young children
   - People who inject illegal drugs
   - People who are sick with other diseases that weaken the immune system
   - Elderly people
   - People who were not treated correctly for TB in the past
  
  
If you have latent TB infection and you are in one of these high-risk groups, you should take medicine to keep from developing TB disease. There are several treatment options for latent TB infection. You and your health care provider must decide which treatment is best for you. If you take your medicine as instructed, it can keep you from developing TB disease. Because there are less bacteria, treatment for latent TB infection is much easier than treatment for TB disease. A person with TB disease has a large amount of TB bacteria in the body. Several drugs are needed to treat TB disease.","
To prevent Tuberculosis (TB), it is important to follow good hygiene practices and maintain a healthy lifestyle. This includes getting vaccinated against pneumonia and the flu, drinking plenty of fluids, avoiding extreme temperatures and high altitudes, and maintaining adequate nutritional intake. Additionally, it is recommended to avoid crowds or other people who have active infections, as TB is often spread through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. If you suspect you may have been exposed to TB, it is important to consult a healthcare provider for a tuberculosis skin test and chest x-ray to rule out the disease."

The bacteria usually attack the lungs, but TB bacteria can attack any part of the body such as the kidney, spine, and brain. If not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal.
  
Not everyone infected with TB bacteria becomes sick. As a result, two TB-related conditions exist: latent TB infection and TB disease. Both latent TB infection and TB disease can be treated. Learn more about the difference between latent TB infection and TB disease.
  
     Treatment for Latent TB Infection
  
People with latent TB infection have TB bacteria in their bodies, but they are not sick because the bacteria are not active. People with latent TB infection do not have symptoms, and they cannot spread TB bacteria to others. However, if TB bacteria become active in the body and multiply, the person will go from having latent TB infection to being sick with TB disease. For this reason, people with latent TB infection are often prescribed treatment to prevent them from developing TB disease. Treatment of latent TB infection is essential for controlling and eliminating TB in the United States.
  
Because there are less bacteria in a person with latent TB infection, treatment is much easier. Four regimens are approved for the treatment of latent TB infection. The medications used to treat latent TB infection include:
  
   - isoniazid (INH)
   - rifampin (RIF)
   - rifapentine (RPT)
  
  
Certain groups of people (such as people with weakened immune systems) are at very high risk of developing TB disease once infected with TB bacteria. Every effort should be made to begin appropriate treatment and to ensure completion of the entire course of treatment for latent TB infection.
  
More: Treatment for Latent TB Infection
  
     Treatment for TB Disease
  
TB bacteria become active (multiplying in the body) if the immune system can't stop them from growing. When TB bacteria are active, this is called TB disease. TB disease will make a person sick. People with TB disease may spread the bacteria to people with whom they spend many hours.
  
TB disease can be treated by taking several drugs for 6 to 9 months. There are 10 drugs currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating TB. Of the approved drugs, the first-line anti-TB agents that form the core of treatment regimens include:
  
   - isoniazid (INH)
   - rifampin (RIF)
   - ethambutol (EMB)
   - pyrazinamide (PZA)
  
  
Regimens for treating TB disease have an initial phase of 2 months, followed by a choice of several options for the continuation phase of either 4 or 7 months (total of 6 to 9 months for treatment). Learn more about the continuation phase of treatment.
  
It is very important that people who have TB disease finish the medicine, taking the drugs exactly as prescribed. If they stop taking the drugs too soon, they can become sick again; if they do not take the drugs correctly, the TB bacteria that are still alive may become resistant to those drugs. TB that is resistant to drugs is harder and more expensive to treat.

     Treatment Completion
  
Treatment completion is determined by the number of doses ingested over a given period of time. Although basic TB regimens are broadly applicable, there are modifications that should be made under special circumstances (such as people with HIV infection, drug resistance, pregnancy, or treatment of children).","
The primary treatments for Tuberculosis (TB) include the Mantoux test or a patch test, which are used to diagnose the disease. If TB is confirmed, the standard treatment is a multi-drug regimen that typically includes isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, taken for 6 to 9 months under a doctor's supervision. In some cases, a short-term course of oral steroids may be used for particularly severe TB outbreaks. It is essential to follow the prescribed treatment plan to ensure the complete eradication of the TB bacteria and prevent the development of drug-resistant strains. If you suspect you have TB, consult a healthcare professional immediately for proper diagnosis and treatment."

  Behavioral and Social Science Research
  Behavioral and social science research has the potential to make a tremendous impact on TB elimination efforts. This research is needed to 1) understand how behaviors of both patients and providers affect TB-related care seeking, diagnosis, treatment success, and prevention; and 2) understand how other social, cultural, and environmental influences affect health seeking and treatment outcomes related to TB.","
There is ongoing research for Tuberculosis (TB) to develop new and more effective diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines. This includes the development of more accurate TB tests such as the Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), which measure the immune response to TB antigens and are less likely to produce false positives than the Mantoux test. Additionally, research is being conducted to find new drugs to treat drug-resistant TB, as well as to improve the existing treatment regimens to make them more tolerable and easier to adhere to. Vaccine research is also being pursued to find a more effective and durable vaccine to prevent TB, as the current BCG vaccine has limited effectiveness in adults."

    - Wash the infested area; towel dry. 
    - Carefully follow the instructions in the package or on the label. Thoroughly saturate the pubic hair and other infested areas with lice medication. Leave medication on hair for the time recommended in the instructions. After waiting the recommended time, remove the medication by following carefully the instructions on the label or in the box. 
    - Following treatment, most nits will still be attached to hair shafts. Nits may be removed with fingernails or by using a fine-toothed comb. 
    - Put on clean underwear and clothing after treatment. 
    - To kill any lice or nits remaining on clothing, towels, or bedding, machine-wash and machine-dry those items that the infested person used during the 2–3 days before treatment. Use hot water (at least 130°F) and the hot dryer cycle. 
    - Items that cannot be laundered can be dry-cleaned or stored in a sealed plastic bag for 2 weeks. 
    - All sex partners from within the previous month should be informed that they are at risk for infestation and should be treated. 
    - Persons should avoid sexual contact with their sex partner(s) until both they and their partners have been successfully treated and reevaluated to rule out persistent infestation. 
    - Repeat treatment in 9–10 days if live lice are still found. 
    - Persons with pubic lice should be evaluated for other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). 
    
   
Special instructions for treatment of lice and nits found on eyebrows or eyelashes: 
    
    - If only a few live lice and nits are present, it may be possible to remove these with fingernails or a nit comb. 
    - If additional treatment is needed for lice or nits on the eyelashes, careful application of ophthalmic-grade petrolatum ointment (only available by prescription) to the eyelid margins 2–4 times a day for 10 days is effective. Regular petrolatum (e.g., Vaseline)* should not be used because it can irritate the eyes if applied.

The treatments for a pubic ""crab"" lice infestation typically involve the use of medications such as ivermectin, albendazole, or diethylcarbamazine. These medications eliminate the larvae, impair the adult worms’ ability to reproduce, and kill adult worms. It's important to note that much of the tissue damage may not be reversible. The medication is started at low doses to prevent adverse reactions. In addition to medication, personal hygiene practices such as washing clothing, bedding, and towels in hot water can help prevent the spread of the infestation. Regularly checking for and promptly treating any new infestations is crucial for managing the condition.

Paragonimiasis, also known as Paragonimus Infection, is a parasitic disease caused by lung flukes, specifically Paragonimus westermani or P. skrjabini. These flukes are larger than liver flukes and can infect not only humans but also meat- or fish-eating animals. The life cycle of these parasites is similar to that of liver flukes, except their encysted larvae infect crabs and crayfish rather than plants or fish. Humans can ingest the infectious larvae by consuming raw or undercooked crab or crayfish. Symptoms of Paragonimiasis may include loss of appetite, fatigue, low-grade fever, diarrhea, and an enlarged liver that feels sore when the abdomen is pressed. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional if these symptoms are present, as treatment may involve anti-parasitic medications.

To diagnose Paragonimiasis, the only sure way is by detecting the parasite itself, either the adult worms or the microfilariae. Microscopic examination of the person's stool may reveal the eggs of the parasite. However, sometimes, people who have been infected for a long time may not have microfilariae in their bloodstream. In such cases, imaging tests such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help identify the presence of the parasite in the liver or other organs.

Wash with soap and water (particularly when visibly soiled) or use alcohol-based hand rubs. Frequently clean areas of the home, such as bathrooms, that may become contaminated with VRE. Wear gloves if hands may come in contact with body fluids that may contain VRE, such as stool or bandages from infected wounds. Always wash their hands after removing gloves. If someone has VRE, be sure to tell healthcare providers so that they are aware of the infection. Healthcare facilities use special precautions to help prevent the spread of VRE to others.

Most patients who receive treatment early experience little, if any, disability. However, there is evidence of slow progression over many years.","
Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) is a rare neurological disorder that affects the motor nerves in the body, causing weakness and muscle atrophy. The outlook for MMN can vary greatly from person to person. Some individuals may experience a slow progression of the condition, while others may experience a more rapid decline.

Treatment for MMN typically involves immunosuppressive therapy, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or plasma exchange, to reduce inflammation and improve nerve function. In some cases, these treatments can slow the progression of the disease and improve symptoms. However, recovery, if it occurs, is often slow and incomplete.

It's important to note that the prognosis for MMN can be influenced by several factors, including the severity and duration of symptoms, the presence of any underlying conditions, and the individual's response to treatment. Some people may experience a remission of symptoms, while others may require ongoing treatment to manage their condition.

If you or someone you know has been diagnosed with MMN, it's important to consult with a neurologist or other healthcare professional for personalized guidance and support. They can help you understand your specific diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis, and work with you to develop a plan for managing your condition. Additionally, joining a support group or connecting with others who have MMN can provide valuable emotional and practical support."

Typically, the pain of occipital neuralgia begins in the neck and then spreads upwards. Some individuals will also experience pain in the scalp, forehead, and behind the eyes. Their scalp may also be tender to the touch, and their eyes especially sensitive to light. The location of pain is related to the areas supplied by the greater and lesser occipital nerves, which run from the area where the spinal column meets the neck, up to the scalp at the back of the head. The pain is caused by irritation or injury to the nerves, which can be the result of trauma to the back of the head, pinching of the nerves by overly tight neck muscles, compression of the nerve as it leaves the spine due to osteoarthritis, or tumors or other types of lesions in the neck. Localized inflammation or infection, gout, diabetes, blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis), and frequent lengthy periods of keeping the head in a downward and forward position are also associated with occipital neuralgia. In many cases, however, no cause can be found. A positive response (relief from pain) after an anesthetic nerve block will confirm the diagnosis.","

Closure of a single suture is most common. Normally the skull expands uniformly to accommodate the growth of the brain; premature closure of a single suture restricts the growth in that part of the skull and promotes growth in other parts of the skull where sutures remain open. This results in a misshapen skull but does not prevent the brain from expanding to a normal volume. However, when many sutures close prematurely, the skull cannot expand to accommodate the growing brain, which leads to increased pressure within the skull and impaired development of the brain. Craniosynostosis can be gene-linked or caused by metabolic diseases (such as rickets )or an overactive thyroid. Some cases are associated with other disorders such as microcephaly (abnormally small head) and hydrocephalus (excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain). The first sign of craniosynostosis is an abnormally shaped skull. Other features can include signs of increased intracranial pressure, developmental delays, or impaired cognitive development, which are caused by constriction of the growing brain. Seizures and blindness may also occur.","
Craniosynostosis is a condition in which one or more of the fibrous joints between the bones of an infant's skull prematurely fuse, limiting the growth of the skull and causing an abnormal head shape. This condition can lead to increased intracranial pressure if not treated promptly. Craniosynostosis can be diagnosed through a physical examination and imaging tests like X-rays or CT scans. Treatment may involve surgery to separate the fused bones and reshape the skull, allowing for normal growth. In some cases, observation and monitoring may be sufficient if the condition is mild.

The vessels are filled with slow-moving or stagnant blood that is usually clotted or in a state of decomposition. Cavernous malformations can occur in the brain, spinal cord, and some other body regions. In the brain and spinal cord these cavernous lesions are quite fragile and are prone to bleeding, causing hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding into the brain), seizures, and neurological deficits. CCMs can range in size from a few fractions of an inch to several inches in diameter, depending on the number of blood vessels involved. Some people develop multiple lesions while others never experience related medical problems. Hereditary forms of CCM are caused by mutations in one of three CCM disease genes: CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3. A large population with hereditary CCM disease is found in New Mexico and the Southwestern United States, in which the disease is caused by mutations in the gene CCM1 (or KRIT1).","

Radiation therapy has not been shown to be effective. The decision to operate is made based upon the risk of approaching the lesion. For example, symptomatic lesions close to the brain surface in non eloquent brain (areas for example, those areas not involved with motor function, speech, vision, hearing, memory, and learning) are very likely to be candidates for removal. On the other hand, lesions located in deep brain areas are associated with higher surgical risk and are often not candidates for surgery until the lesion has bled multiple times. Medications can often lessen general symptoms such as headache, back pain, and seizures.","
The treatments for Cavernous Malformation, a type of congenital heart disease, typically involve surgical procedures to repair the defect and restore circulation. Drugs such as diuretics and digoxin may be used to aid the baby in excreting water and salts, and to strengthen the heart and slow the heartbeat, respectively. If a growth is detected, a biopsy may be performed to determine if it's benign or malignant. In some cases, cryotherapy may be considered for growth removal, but care should be taken in patients with diabetes or certain circulation problems, as healing can be poor and the risk of infection can be higher. If the ulcer does not heal, surgery to increase blood flow to the foot may be necessary.

The context provided does not directly address Locked-In Syndrome, but it does mention coma, which is a condition related to Locked-In Syndrome. Locked-In Syndrome is a rare disorder that affects a person's ability to communicate and move voluntarily, while consciousness remains intact.

In the case of coma, the outlook can vary greatly depending on the cause, severity, and duration of the coma. Some individuals may recover fully, while others may experience long-term effects such as cognitive or physical impairments. For those who do recover, rehabilitation and therapy can play a crucial role in helping them regain their abilities.

For Locked-In Syndrome, the outlook can also be challenging due to the nature of the disorder. However, with appropriate medical care, rehabilitation, and support, some individuals with Locked-In Syndrome have shown significant improvement over time. It's important to note that each case is unique, and the recovery process can be lengthy and demanding.

In cases where an individual is diagnosed with Locked-In Syndrome, they may benefit from working with a team of specialists, including neurologists, rehabilitation therapists, and speech-language pathologists. They may also find support from organizations dedicated to helping individuals with neurological disorders, such as the Coma Recovery Association, Inc.

Most people with Lyme disease develop a characteristic skin rash around the area of the bite. The rash may feel hot to the touch, and vary in size, shape, and color, but it will often have a ""bull's eye"" appearance (a red ring with a clear center). However, there are those who will not develop the rash, which can make Lyme disease hard to diagnose because its symptoms and signs mimic those of many other diseases.
                
Anywhere from 7 to 14 days (or in some cases, 30 days) following an infected tick's bite, the first stage of Lyme disease may begin with flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, fatigue, muscle aches, and joint pain.
                
Neurological complications most often occur in the second stage of Lyme disease, with numbness, pain, weakness, Bell's palsy (paralysis of the facial muscles), visual disturbances, and meningitis symptoms such as fever, stiff neck, and severe headache. Other problems, which may not appear until weeks, months, or years after a tick bite, include decreased concentration, irritability, memory and sleep disorders, and nerve damage in the arms and legs.","
Machado-Joseph Disease, also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, is a rare inherited disorder that affects the nervous system. The complications of this disease primarily involve the degeneration of various parts of the nervous system, leading to a range of symptoms. Some of the common complications include:

1. Ataxia: This is a loss of coordination and balance, which can affect the ability to walk, speak, and perform fine motor skills.
2. Dysarthria: This is a speech disorder caused by muscle weakness or paralysis, resulting in slurred or slow speech.
3. Dysphagia: This is difficulty swallowing, which can lead to problems with eating and drinking.
4. Ophthalmoparesis: This is a weakness or paralysis of the eye muscles, causing problems with eye movement and vision.
5. Scoliosis: This is a curvature of the spine, which can lead to back pain and postural problems.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: These are irregular heart rhythms that can potentially be life-threatening.
7. Respiratory failure: This is a condition where the lungs cannot supply enough oxygen to the body, which can be a serious complication due to muscle weakness affecting the respiratory muscles.

Wolmans disease (also known as acid lipase deficiency) is an autosomal recessive disorder marked by the buildup of cholesteryl esters (normally a tranport form of cholesterol that brings nutrients into the cells and carries out waste) and triglycerides (a chemical form in which fats exist in the body). Infants with the disorder appear normal at birth but quickly develop progressive mental deterioration, low muscle tone,enlarged liver and grossly enlarged spleen, gastrointestinal problems including an excessive amount of fats in the stools, jaundice, anemia, vomiting, and calcium deposits in the adrenal glands, which causes them to harden. Both male and female infants are affected by the disorder.
                
Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) is an extremely rare disorder that results from storage of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in cells in the blood and lymph and lymphoid tissue. Children develop an enlarged liver, leading to cirrhosis and chronic liver failure before adulthood. Children may also develop calcium deposits in the adrenal glands and jaundice. Onset varies, and the disorder may not be diagnosed until adulthood.","
Acid lipase disease, also known as Wolman disease or cholesterol ester storage disease, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down fats (lipids) in the digestive system. This disorder results in the accumulation of fats in various organs, including the liver, pancreas, and adrenal glands, leading to serious health problems. Acid lipase deficiency specifically impairs the breakdown of triglycerides and cholesterol esters, which can cause a buildup of these substances in the body. Symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, poor growth, and liver problems. If left untreated, acid lipase disease can be fatal in early childhood.

In ACC the corpus callosum is partially or completely absent. It is caused by a disruption of brain cell migration during fetal development. ACC can occur as an isolated condition or in combination with other cerebral abnormalities, including Arnold-Chiari malformation, Dandy-Walker syndrome, schizencephaly (clefts or deep divisions in brain tissue), and holoprosencephaly (failure of the forebrain to divide into lobes.) Girls may have a gender-specific condition called Aicardi syndrome, which causes severe cognitive impairment and developmental delays, seizures, abnormalities in the vertebra of the spine, and lesions on the retina of the eye. ACC can also be associated with malformations in other parts of the body, such as midline facial defects. The effects of the disorder range from subtle or mild to severe, depending on associated brain abnormalities. Children with the most severe brain malformations may have intellectual impairment, seizures, hydrocephalus, and spasticity. Other disorders of the corpus callosum include dysgenesis, in which the corpus callosum is developed in a malformed or incomplete way, and hypoplasia, in which the corpus callosum is thinner than usual. Individuals with these disorders have a higher risk of hearing deficits and cardiac abnormalities than individuals with the normal structure.

The painseldomlasts more than a few seconds or a minute or twoper episode. The intensity of pain can be physically and mentally incapacitating. TN pain is typically felt on one side of the jaw or cheek. Episodes can last for days, weeks, or months at a time and then disappear for months or years. In the days before an episode begins, some patients may experience a tingling or numbing sensation or a somewhat constant and aching pain. The attacks often worsen over time, with fewer and shorter pain-free periods before they recur. The intense flashes of pain can be triggered by vibration or contact with the cheek (such as when shaving, washing the face, or applying makeup), brushing teeth, eating, drinking, talking, or being exposed to the wind. TN occurs most often in people over age 50, but it can occur at any age, and is more common in women than in men. There is some evidence that the disorder runs in families, perhaps because of an inherited pattern of blood vessel formation. Although sometimes debilitating, the disorder is not life-threatening.
                
The presumed cause of TN is a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve in the head as it exits the brainstem. TN may be part of the normal aging process but in some cases it is the associated with another disorder, such as multiple sclerosis or other disorders characterized by damage to the myelin sheath that covers certain nerves.","
Trigeminal Neuralgia is a chronic pain condition that affects the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for carrying sensation from the face to the brain. It is also known as tic douloureux. The trigeminal nerve branches out into three parts, each of which may cause pain in the face, jaw, or around the eyes. The pain is typically described as sharp, electric, or stabbing and can be triggered by simple things like brushing teeth, talking, or eating. The exact cause of trigeminal neuralgia is not known, but it is often associated with pressure on the trigeminal nerve due to a blood vessel pressing on it.

But finding the cause of the pain is important as the treatments for different types of pain may differ. Treatment options include medicines such as anticonvulsants and tricyclic antidepressants, surgery, and complementary approaches. Typical analgesics and opioids are not usually helpful in treating the sharp, recurring pain caused by TN. If medication fails to relieve pain or produces intolerable side effects such as excess fatigue, surgical treatment may be recommended. Several neurosurgical procedures are available. Some are done on an outpatient basis, while others are more complex and require hospitalization. Some patients choose to manage TN using complementary techniques, usually in combination with drug treatment. These techniques include acupuncture, biofeedback, vitamin therapy, nutritional therapy, and electrical stimulation of the nerves.","
Treatments for Trigeminal Neuralgia may include medication such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin or ibuprofen. If these drugs are ineffective, a short-term prescription for corticosteroids or muscle relaxants may be given. For chronic pain, tricyclic antidepressants can be prescribed. In some cases, traction may be suggested, either at home with the advice of a physical therapist or in a healthcare setting. Additionally, alternative treatments such as acupuncture, homeopathic treatment, and the use of nervous system relaxant herbs like valerian, chamomile, rosemary, and skullcap can be beneficial. If the pain is severe, a short treatment of epidural corticosteroids may be prescribed with discretion, involving the injection of a corticosteroid and an anesthetic into the space between the damaged disk and the covering of the nerve and spinal cord."

In the developing brain, neurons must migrate from the areas where they are born to the areas where they will settle into their proper neural circuits. Neuronal migration, which occurs as early as the second month of gestation, is controlled by a complex assortment of chemical guides and signals. When these signals are absent or incorrect, neurons do not end up where they belong. This can result in structurally abnormal or missing areas of the brain in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, or hippocampus. The structural abnormalities found in NMDs include schizencephaly, porencephaly, lissencephaly, agyria, macrogyria, polymicrogyria, pachygyria, microgyria, micropolygyria, neuronal heterotopias (including band heterotopia), agenesis of the corpus callosum, and agenesis of the cranial nerves. Symptoms vary according to the abnormality, but often feature poor muscle tone and motor function, seizures, developmental delays, impaired cognitive development, failure to grow and thrive, difficulties with feeding, swelling in the extremities, and a smaller than normal head. Most infants with an NMD appear normal, but some disorders have characteristic facial or skull features that can be recognized by a neurologist. Several genetic abnormalities in children with NMDs have been identified. Defects in genes that are involved in neuronal migration have been associated with NMDs, but the role they play in the development of these disorders is not yet well-understood. More than 25 syndromes resulting from abnormal neuronal migration have been described. Among them are syndromes with several different patterns of inheritance; genetic counseling thus differs greatly between syndromes.","
Neuronal Migration Disorders are a group of conditions characterized by abnormal brain development, specifically the improper movement of neurons (nerve cells) from their origin to their final destination in the brain. These disorders can lead to various neurological symptoms, such as seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delays, and behavioral problems. Some common examples of Neuronal Migration Disorders include Lissencephaly (smooth brain), Schizencephaly (cleft brain), and Migration-associated hemiplegia (hemiplegic migraine). These disorders can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired later in life, and they may have genetic or environmental causes. Diagnosis is typically made through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and imaging studies like MRI or CT scans. Treatment options for Neuronal Migration Disorders vary depending on the specific disorder and its severity, but may include medications, physical therapy, and, in some cases, surgery."

Some children with autism grow up to lead normal or near-normal lives. Children whose language skills regress early in life, usually before the age of 3, appear to be at risk of developing epilepsy or seizure-like brain activity. During adolescence, some children with autism may become depressed or experience behavioral problems. Parents of these children should be ready to adjust treatment for their child as needed. People with an ASD usually continue to need services and support as they get older but many are able to work successfully and live independently or within a supportive environment.","
The outlook for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) can vary greatly, as the severity and symptoms of ASD can range widely. While there is no cure for ASD, early intervention and appropriate support can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with the condition.

Individuals with ASD may face challenges in social interaction, communication, and behavior. They may have difficulty understanding and responding to social cues, and may exhibit repetitive behaviors or interests. Some individuals with ASD may also have difficulty regulating their emotions, leading to outbursts or self-injurious behavior.

Treatment for ASD often involves a combination of behavioral, educational, and therapeutic interventions. Behavioral interventions, such as applied behavior analysis (ABA), can help individuals with ASD learn new skills and reduce challenging behaviors. Speech and language therapy can help improve communication skills, while occupational therapy can help with daily living skills.

It's important to note that every individual with ASD is unique, and their needs and responses to treatment will vary. Some individuals with ASD may require ongoing support and accommodations throughout their lives, while others may be able to live independently with the appropriate support.

Antibiotics for most types of meningitis can greatly reduce the risk of dying from the disease. Antiviral medications may be prescribed for viral encephalitis or other severe viral infections.Anticonvulsants are used to prevent or treat seizures. Corticosteroidd rugs can reduce brain swelling and inflammation. Over-the-counter medications may be used for fever and headache. Individuals with encephalitis or bacterial meningitis are usually hospitalized for treatment. Affected individuals with breathing difficulties may require artificial respiration.,"
Meningitis is not mentioned in the provided context, but here is the treatment for Encephalitis:

Encephalitis is typically treated based on the cause, with bacterial encephalitis treated using antibiotics and viral encephalitis treated with antiviral drugs. Antiviral drugs that may be used include acyclovir, ganciclovir, foscarnet, ribavirin, and AZT. Viruses that respond to acyclovir include herpes simplex, the most common cause of sporadic (non-epidemic) encephalitis in the United States.

Symptoms of encephalitis may be treated with corticosteroids like prednisone and dexamethasone to reduce inflammation and brain swelling, anti-convulsant drugs like dilantin and phenytoin to control seizures, and fever-reducing drugs like acetaminophen.

A person with encephalitis must be closely monitored, as symptoms may change rapidly. Regular blood tests may be required to track levels of fluids and salts in the blood.

Encephalitis symptoms may last several weeks, and most cases are mild, with recovery usually quick and no residual neurological problems. However, approximately 10% of those with encephalitis die from their infections or complications such as secondary infection. Some forms of encephalitis, like herpes encephalitis, have more severe courses, with mortality rates of 15–20% with treatment and 70–80% without.
